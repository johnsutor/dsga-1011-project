You may have heard the term fricassee thrown around before in reference to cooking, but do you know exactly what a fricassee is and what type of cuisine it refers to? Fricassee is actually a French style of cooking. The word literally translates to cooking chopped food in its own juice, though modern fricassee is known for the thick, white sauce in which it's served.

This cooking technique can be made with any meat, though chicken and veal are the two most common. The meat of choice is cooked slowly in oil at a low temperature — without browning. After the meat is cooked, it's removed, and aromatic vegetables like garlic, onion, and celery are added to cook with seasoning. When the vegetables are soft, the meat goes back in with flour to make a roux from the leftover fat in the pan. White wine deglazes the pan, then chicken or veal stock is poured in, and the whole thing simmers until the sauce is nice and velvety. Finally, cooked vegetables such as bell peppers and mushrooms go in at the end, alongside herbs to finish."

A day after Barstool Sports CEO Dave Portnoy got into a heated altercation with the owner of Dragon Pizza in Somerville, Massachusetts, the pizzeria was packed with seemingly satisfied customers.

One customer even disagreed with Portnoy’s review, giving his piece — a maple bacon slice — a much higher rating than Portnoy did.

“I’d give this one probably around a 9 [out of 10]… But it is a little floppy, I do have to agree there,” the customer told The Post while chewing. “Yeah, I saw [the altercation]. I thought it was better than he rated it, but that’s just my taste. The owner, [identified by the Boston Globe as Charlie Redd], seemed a little bit out of control, maybe he was having a bad day.

“It got caught on camera, I think that’s what it was.”

The 46-year-old Portnoy, who recently reacquired Barstool Sports from Penn Entertainment for $1, visited the pizza shop for one of his pizza reviews, which has been one of his trademarks since he rose to sports media prominence.

In a series now dubbed “One Bite,” Portnoy visits famous pizzerias and, well, takes one bite and subsequently records a review of the pizza right outside the restaurant, giving it a rating from 1-10.

Portnoy clearly did not enjoy his slice from Dragon Pizza and began ragging on it as “trash” and a “floppy mess,” giving it a 6.4 rating.

That’s when Redd walked out and confronted Portnoy.

“Enjoy your pizza as any customer, but I don’t appreciate what you do, coming in and judging a business in one bite,” Redd said.

After Portnoy responded that he helps small businesses, the owner shot back, “I don’t see it that way,” before going back into the pizzeria.

A few moments later, Redd re-emerged and told Portnoy to stop standing in front of his business.

“Let me be clear, f–k you,” Portnoy shot back repeatedly before calling the owner a “motherf–ker” and an “a–hole.”

Redd threatened to call the police, and when Portnoy asked what for, he replied, “for being a f–king bitch.”

Though Redd could be seen in the pizzeria on Friday, he appeared to have no interest in using the attention for newfound fame.

The customer who gave the 9 out of 10 rating said his decision to visit Dragon Pizza on Friday was in part due to Portnoy’s review.

246,2023/09/01, 'blanket and prince jackson',https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-12462379/Michael-Jacksons-sons-Prince-Blanket-low-key-lives.html,"Unlike Michael Jackson, his sons, Prince and Blanket (now known as Bigi), have tried to stay out of the spotlight - something their father was unable to avoid up until his untimely death.

So their rare public outing in Las Vegas for a performance of Michael Jackson ONE by Cirque du Soleil caused quite a stir on the ground at the Mandalay Bay Resort And Casino - and online.

This past Tuesday would have marked their late father's 65th birthday.

Michael's eldest son Prince, who is one of two children (the other is daughter Paris) the King Of Pop shared with first wife Debbie Rowe, sported a gray T-shirt, blue jeans, and a baseball cap - that bared the logo of his foundation - for the show. The 26-year-old also rocked a well-trimmed short beard.

Prince, 26, and Blanket Jackson, 21, were seen chatting with guests at Sin City's Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino after a Michael Jackson ONE by Cirque du Soleil showing on Tuesday

Blanket - who is now known as Bigi - with his brother, Prince, and sister Paris in 2012

Meanwhile the pop superstar's youngest Bigi, who's rarely seen in public and now aged 21, wore a casual black button up with matching pants and shoes.

The brothers live a relatively low-key life compared to that of their late singer father, who won acclaim for the mega hits Thriller, Beat It and Billie Jean. He died in June 2009 at the age of 50 after acute propofol and benzodiazepine intoxication at his home in Los Angeles, leaving behind his three children.

While Michael's daughter Paris, 25, has followed in their father's footsteps by pursuing a career in music, Prince and Bigi have gone down different paths.

Prince, born Michael Joseph Jackson Jr., got his degree in business administration in 2019 before starting a foundation to help young people in Los Angeles, while also running a production company.

Even less is know about the pursuits of his younger brother, Bigi, who was welcomed by surrogate in 2002 and given the name of Prince Michael Jackson II.

With their surprise appearance on Tuesday comes the public's natural curiosity about them, so what do we know about Michael's sons?

To answer your burning questions, FEMAIL takes a look inside the low-key lives of Prince and Bigi.

Michael's oldest son graduated with a business administration degree before starting up Heal Los Angeles with a college friend

The eldest child of Michael was born on February 13, 1997. His mother is the Thriller singer's first wife Debbie Rowe.

He counts Home Alone star Macaulay Culkin and late Hollywood icon Elizabeth Taylor as his godparents.

After his parents divorced in 1999, Prince lived with his dad on his famous Neverland Ranch and was then raised by his grandmother, Katherine, following Michael's death.

In May 2019, he revealed he had graduated cum laude at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, 'with a focus on entrepreneurship.'

Prince thanked his cousins - TJ, Taryll and Taj - for helping him graduate with a bachelor's degree in business administration.

'[They] kept pushing me to graduate and finish up my degree when I wanted to quit,' he wrote at the time.

Prince graduated in 2019 cum laude from Loyola Marymount University with a bachelor's degree in business administration. He's pictured at his graduation with brother Bigi

During his college days, he met John Muto and the pair went on to found the Heal Los Angeles Foundation in 2016

'Honestly I can't tell you if all of it was worth it yet but I am proud of my degree as I believe it is a testament to my dedication and discipline.'

During his college days, he met John Muto and the pair went on to found the Heal Los Angeles Foundation in 2016.

According to its website, the foundation's mission aims to 'improve the lives of young people' through 'impactful programs' that will arm them with life skills to help them 'pursue their dreams.'

One of the services Heal was able to provide during the COVID pandemic included delivering meals to people who were struggling in 2020.

'I would like to think that [my dad would be] be very proud, because I think this was one of his main goals - not only to spread his message of positivity and happiness, but to see it enacted in his kids,' Prince told Entertainment Tonight at the time.

'As a father, I think that's what you want to do when you raise kids. You're preparing them for the world and the type of person they're going to be.'

On his Instagram, Prince has shared some images at a number of events held by Heal.

Along with the foundation, Prince also runs a production company, King's Son Productions, which looks to produce, shoot, edit and create content 'ranging from cinematic music videos and short films to feature-length films and beyond.'

He showcases his love of motorcycles on his YouTube page by taking viewers on his rides.

Bigi, who was known as Blanket, lives a reclusive life, but has a passion for climate change issues

The least is know about the youngest Jackson child. He was born via surrogate on February 21, 2002.

For most of his life, the now 21-year-old was known as Blanket, but he started going by a new moniker in 2015, according to Today.

His older brother is his 'best friend,' a family friend told People back in 2019.

'They share a lot of interests like science and sci-fi,' they added.

Bigi and Prince share interests, which include science and sci-fi. They also love Marvel and announced they were starting a movie review channel in 2019 (pictured)

They also seem to be fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, with Prince announcing in 2019 he and his brother were going to launch a movie review channel on YouTube, Entertainment Tonight reported.

Only one episode still exists on Prince's YouTube channel where they review Avengers: Endgame with their cousin, Taj, and special guest James Sutherland.

Bigi appeared to be a massive Marvel fan and had seen Endgame three times up until that point, according to the publication.

In 2020, sister Paris marked Bigi's 18th birthday with a series of photos posted on Instagram.

Bigi also gave an interview to Good Morning Britain back in 2021, speaking about his passion for environmentalism ahead of the COP26 climate change conference

'My brother is a legal adult today. what the f***,' she wrote.

'I used to change his diapers. this is such a trip... proud of the handsome, intelligent, insightful, funny, and kind young man he has become.

'He likes privacy so that's all i gotta say. hbd lil bro.'

248,2023/09/01, 'nebraska football score',https://theathletic.com/4825765/2023/09/01/nebraska-football-minnesota-matt-rhule/,"MINNEAPOLIS — Matt Rhule cannot coach or coax the bad habits and brutal recent history out of Nebraska.

It can only come from within. The Huskers, their coaches and staff, many new to the football program, exited the locker room Thursday night at Huntington Bank Stadium and walked through a gray corridor draped in disappointment toward the rest of a season that started — yet again — on a sour note.

Advertisement

“I just told our team,” Rhule said, “I want to make sure I say this: There are no such thing as close losses.”

Oh, but at Nebraska, there are.

Nebraska collapsed late, losing 13-10 at Minnesota. For all the work of the past nine months in Lincoln — the changes in attitude, the arduous mat drills, the gains in strength and conditioning, the attention to new details and a preseason camp that brought the Huskers close — many of the old doubts remain.

They’re like a virus, subdued and quiet until the moment arrives to emerge and strike.

Nebraska is now 2-14 in one-score finishes since the start of 2021. Genuinely incredible. — Bill Connelly (@ESPN_BillC) September 1, 2023

Rhule did not experience those gut punches. But most of his players did.

Nebraska started one player Thursday on defense, freshman defensive end Cameron Lenhardt, and two on offense, transfers Jeff Sims at quarterback and Ben Scott at center, who are new to the program this year. Nine others contributed against Minnesota, plus the kicker and long-snapper, who were not with Nebraska last season.

And to all of the ever-present Nebraska fan base, this loss felt like the next chapter in a never-ending, sad story.

I’m an idiot. It’s no change. I tried to convince myself with the rhetoric. Nothing is different. Pain. Sadness. Devastation. — Jack Mitchell (@JackMitchellLNK) September 1, 2023

The fans show up no matter what, selling out Memorial Stadium for more than 60 years. But their emotional baggage comes, too. After any loss, it can be a bit of a drag on the football environment.

So Rhule might not want to act as if the past doesn’t matter.

“I’m not even thinking about anything that happened before I got here,” Rhule said. “It has nothing to do with me. I don’t want our players to think about that. I’m thinking about what’s next. I’m thinking about getting back and watching this tape tomorrow. I’m thinking about next week.”

Rhule said the Huskers need to focus on eliminating turnovers, like the four that they committed against Minnesota, and fixing third-down performance. The Gophers converted eight of 17 opportunities, plus two of two fourth downs, including the 13-yard touchdown strike on fourth-and-10 that tied the score, 10-10, with 2:32 to play.

The coach is right, of course. Rhule knows the formula to play winning football. But in that locker room Thursday and on the field during the final five minutes when everything went wrong for the Huskers, it’s about more than fixing mistakes.

It’s about understanding that the past does mean something to many of the Huskers. It’s about ridding the program of a defeatist mentality. The blank stares and pained expressions on Nebraska faces Thursday night looked familiar to what we saw after Nebraska played at Minnesota in 2021, 2019 and 2017.

Their comments sounded familiar, too.

“We just can’t beat ourselves,” running back Rahmir Johnson said.

Said linebacker Luke Reimer: “It’s a tough loss. Obviously, those older guys, we’ve been through some tough losses. So you just kind of … lick your wounds and watch the film. Good, bad, ugly, whatever the film says, you just take it and get back to work.”

The film will say that Nebraska nearly had its opener in the bag.

Sims hit Johnson for a 6-yard gain and a first down to move the Huskers across midfield with five minutes to play. To that point, despite a bungled series at the end of the first half and an offense that lacked playmakers aside from the mercurial QB, the first game for Rhule unfolded just as he envisioned.

Rhule got Nebraska to play ugly, methodical and tough for 55 minutes.

The coach simply wanted to trade punches until the fourth quarter with Minnesota, which long ago established its identity under seventh-year coach P.J. Fleck. And then the Huskers planned to take it.

Instead, the Gophers took it — first by forcing an Anthony Grant fumble on a solid hit by cornerback Justin Walley. Next came the fourth-down throw to the end zone. Before the touchdown pass, Minnesota left tackle Aireontae Ersery jumped.

TOUCHDOWN MINNESOTA 😱 On 4&10 Daniel Jackson comes up with a HUGE catch for @GopherFootball pic.twitter.com/84QofhnsEe — FOX College Football (@CFBONFOX) September 1, 2023

I saw it from the press box 60 yards away and high above the field. It should have been a false start.

Nebraska fans saw it. And they complained. I heard it on social media, on the streets outside the stadium, in a Minneapolis hotel Friday morning. The Huskers will see the officials’ mistake on tape.

And here’s how Nebraska as a program can heal and avoid a repeat of Thursday: Let it go. Missed calls happen. This was critically bad timing. Yes, the margin for error with Nebraska is thin. But instead of lamenting their predicament, hold on to the ball in the final minutes.

Good teams take control. Nebraska habitually leaves it in the hands of others.

Don’t throw an interception in the last minute. Sims, driving for an attempt at the game-winning field goal or to get to overtime, found safety Tyler Nubin while looking for tight end Nate Boerkircher on second-and-6 from the Minnesota 46.

It was a poor decision and a poor pass.

Win the moments that matter.

“We can’t beat ourselves,” Sims said. “We need to protect the ball.”

I cannot believe Nebraska is going to lose a Scott Frost game in Matt Rhule’s debut. — Ari Wasserman (@AriWasserman) September 1, 2023

Much of what led to Nebraska heartbreak Thursday does not fall under the category of surprise. Grant fumbled in the Huskers’ final scrimmage of August. Rhule called him out. Thursday night, the coach was careful to protect his running back.

“He feels terrible,” Rhule said.

In 25 starts at Georgia Tech over three years, Sims tossed 23 interceptions and lost 10 fumbles. On Thursday, he was intercepted three times.

“It’s Game 1,” Johnson said. “That’s still my quarterback. I know he’s going to have some big games down the line.”

Nebraska must put a few more playmakers around the QB.

It lost wide receiver Isaiah Garcia-Castaneda Thursday to injury. Marcus Washington served a first-half suspension and caught three balls after halftime. The Huskers need Billy Kemp IV, targeted twice without a catch, and tight end Thomas Fidone II.

For years, the remedy has looked simple. Just get out of your own way, Nebraska. When the doubts creep in, fight and find a way to win. Then win again. Rhule can’t convince the Huskers to find a new sense of confidence.

But he can instill accountability. It’s a piece of the puzzle.

At the end Thursday, Rhule said, some of the Huskers raced for the locker room without looking back. He stopped them.

“We’re the University of Nebraska,” Rhule said. “Everything we do, we do in a first-class manner. We hate that we lost. We’re disappointed. But we’re going to come back.”

The opportunity is here. Colorado, Northern Illinois and Louisiana Tech, up next, provide a ticket for the Huskers to a solid start. The Buffs, possibly more vulnerable then even Nebraska, await next week in Boulder.

“We’re on the front end of something,” Rhule said.

The front of what?

GO DEEPER Quick thoughts on Nebraska's late loss to Minnesota

Look, Nebraska is a better team than it showed at the end Thursday. It hit hard and swarmed to the ball on defense. Tony White’s group will create problems. It showed something in standing for 60 minutes in the ring with the Gophers.

Remove emotion from that loss. Nebraska had an opportunity to win and let victory slip away. Its story, no matter how things felt after the opener, is unwritten. All those doubts don’t need to define Nebraska in 2023.

It’s on the Huskers to convince themselves that a path past the self-inflicted pain exists.

249,2023/09/01, 'stein',https://www.brooklynvegan.com/dave-stein-nyhc-figure-lawyer-for-several-hardcore-bands-has-died/,"Dave Stein, aka “The Hardcore Attorney,” has passed away. He was an entertainment lawyer for several bands, ranging from Agnostic Front to Sick Of It All to Madball to Shelter to Shutdown to Taking Back Sunday to The Starting Line, and he was also a musician, produced the first Absolution 7″, sang on Agnostic Front records, owned the labels Combined Effort Records and Mendit, and promoted shows. His sister Elissa broke the news:

This morning the world lost the most resilient, awe-inspiring, fierce warrior I’ve ever known: my hero and my little brother Dave Stein. He let go with grace and ease, after saying he could still fight if there was something to fight for. But it was his time.

Dave had cancer when he was 9 months old and battled endless illnesses and set backs his entire life, but he never, ever, like EVER let that stop him. He was PMA (positive mental attitude) and straight edge and a vegan and saw the world in pretty stark black and white. He worked harder than anyone I know. Was my personal IT guru. His shopping skills were legendary as was his ability to recall a joke at even the most challenging moments, like heading into surgery. Music was his life blood and he combined that with his singular organizational abilities to be a force as an entertainment lawyer with gold and platinum records hanging in his house. He was silly and goofy and kind and loyal and whip smart and was so grateful for his life even with all the extra hardships he had to contend with. He loved his wife beyond words, his rescue dogs who brought him such great joy, his family which sometimes drove him crazy, and his friends whom he considered family.

I’ve felt an extra bond with him the past 12 plus years since he’s had a piece of me inside of him. Sid, his kidney named after one of our favorite cousins, was still going strong until the very end. This photo was from June, our 12th rebirthday, as he called it, which we celebrated in the hospital with his favorite Vegan Treats cakes.

There are so many things I could share: he was morally offended at anyone who would wear competing logos like Pumas and Adidas at the same time. He owned more Champion sweatshirts than most stores have in inventory. He stopped cutting his hair and started growing a beard when his original kidney started to fail, saying his hair was the only thing that was working and he’d cut it all off when he got a new one. Bane of my mother’s existence that even with a new kidney he never chopped it which is why I always secretly thought he kept it all. I would love to know something you shared with Dave if you’d like to share it here. He was so loved and made such a positive impact in so many lives.

Love you bro (insert our not so secret handshake here)."
250,2023/09/02,'jimmy buffett',https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/02/entertainment/jimmy-buffett-death/index.html,"CNN —

Jimmy Buffett, the tropical troubadour whose folksy tunes celebrated his laid-back lifestyle, inspired legions of devoted fans and spawned a lucrative business empire, has died, according to his official website and multiple media outlets.

He was 76.

“Jimmy passed away peacefully on the night of September 1st surrounded by his family, friends, music and dogs,” a statement released on his social page reads.

“He lived his life like a song till the very last breath and will be missed beyond measure by so many,” the statement continued.

Buffett had been fighting Merkel cell skin cancer at the time of his death, according to an updated obituary on his official website. He had the disease for four years and continued to perform during treatment.

The singer-songwriter was briefly hospitalized in May following a trip to the Bahamas. “I had to stop in Boston for a checkup but wound up back in the hospital to address some issues that needed immediate attention,” he told his followers in a social media post.

Buffett posted a day later that he was soon headed home from the hospital, and thanked his followers for the “outpouring of support and well wishes.” He did not share what was ailing him, but said that he’d be going on a “fishing trip with old friends, along with paddling and sailing and get myself back in good shape” upon his return home from the hospital.

The music world pays tribute

Mourners paid tribute on social media Saturday, including country superstar Kenny Chesney, whose own sun-kissed approach owes a lot to Buffett.

Chesney tweeted, “So goodbye Jimmy. Thanks for your friendship and the songs I will carry in my heart forever. Sail On Sailor.” And he shared a video of himself singing Buffett’s song “Son of a Son of a Sailor” on a beach.

“The pirate has passed. RIP Jimmy Buffett. Tremendous influence on so many of us,” wrote Toby Keith.

Brian Wilson of the Beach Boys wrote, “Love and Mercy, Jimmy Buffett.”

Elton John wrote on Instagram: “Jimmy Buffett was a unique and treasured entertainer. His fans adored him and he never let them down. This is the saddest of news. A lovely man gone way too soon.”

Paul McCartney shared his fond memories of Buffett as “one of the kindest and most generous people” on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.

“Right up to the last minute, his eyes still twinkled with a humour that said, ‘I love this world and I’m going to enjoy every minute of it,’” McCartney wrote.

“So many of us will miss Jimmy and his tremendous personality, his love for us all and for mankind as a whole,” he said.

Amiable grooves and clever wordplay

Buffett was born on Christmas Day 1946 in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and raised in the port town of Mobile, Alabama. He moved to Key West, Florida, where he found his voice, his website says.

One of his first songs to draw attention was “Come Monday,” from his 1974 album “Living & Dying in ¾ Time.”

Years later he told David Letterman, “This is a song that kept me from killing myself in a Howard Johnson’s in Marin County. It hit, I paid the rent, got my dog out of the pound. … and the rest is history.”

It notably included the line, “I got my hush puppies on, I guess I never was meant for glitter rock ‘n’ roll,” staking his claim to going his own laid-back way.

An amiable singer-songwriter with a penchant for clever wordplay, Buffett largely ignored pop music trends and was never a hitmaker or an MTV darling. His “Gulf & Western” style married country and Caribbean music.

He famously put “Margaritaville” on the map in 1977. It was his only Top 10 song and became his signature.

Its opening lines became instantly identifiable: “Nibbling on spongecake, watching the sun bake, all of the tourists covered with oil …”

And the chorus has been part of countless singalongs: “Wasted away again in Margaritaville, searching for my lost shaker of salt… Some people claim that there’s a woman to blame, but I know, it’s my own damn fault.”

Adored by his ‘parrotheads’

Buffett built an enormous cult of fans, affectionately known as “Parrotheads,” after the legendary Deadhead fans of the Grateful Dead.

“The audience are so much fun for me to look at,” he said. “I mean, they’re as entertaining to me as I hope I am to them.”

Other must-play concert tunes included “Cheeseburger in Paradise,” “Fins,” “Volcano” and “Why Don’t We Get Drunk.”

His followers lovingly embraced his vision of life spent in flip-flops, full of beaches, boats, booze and weed.

“From New Orleans to the Gulf Coast down into St. Barts and other places, I still can find magic in most of those places where people think there isn’t any left,” he said.

A savvy marketer, Buffett later parlayed the “Margaritaville” mythos to power his career through decades of lucrative concert tours – and branding of restaurants, casinos, retirement communities, bestselling books and even a musical.

His worth was estimated at $1 billion, according to Forbes.

Buffett, who was inducted into the Nashville Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2006, won two Country Music Association awards during his career and was twice nominated for Grammy Awards.

A rare misstep came with a 2018 Broadway show, “Escape to Margaritaville,” shaped out of his best-known tunes.

Even the brutal New York Times review noted the irony of Buffett’s slacker image against his staggering success: “Mr. Buffett, Margaritaville’s prototype and mastermind, has a wife and family and 5,000 employees; he works nonstop.”

Before his death, Buffett was preparing to release a new record, with songs previewed weekly on Radio Margaritaville, according to his website.

Loyal to his party credo until the end, he left a forthcoming song titled, “My Gummy Just Kicked In.”

251,2023/09/02, 'travis hunter',https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/38316334/colorado-coach-prime-deion-sanders-college-football-sheduer-travis-hunter,"FORT WORTH, Texas -- On the first weekend of the 2023 season, hype gave way to history.

Deion Sanders arrived in Texas with 86 new Colorado players -- an unprecedented remodel -- and took down No. 17 TCU 45-42 in the Horned Frogs' first game since a College Football Playoff National Championship game appearance.

The Buffaloes were a 21-point underdog, giving Coach Prime the first win by an underdog of more than 20 points in his full-time FBS coaching debut since the 1978 FBS/FCS split.

""We're going to continuously be questioned because we do things that have never been done,"" Deion Sanders said. ""We do things that have never been done and that makes people uncomfortable.""

The cornerstone stars of Sanders' transfer congregation -- Shedeur Sanders and Travis Hunter, who both came with him from Jackson State -- definitely made the Horned Frogs uncomfortable. Along the way, they erased years of futility for Colorado in just one game:

• Shedeur Sanders completed 38 of 47 passes for 510 yards, the most passing yards by a player in his FBS debut over the past 25 years, while also becoming the first Colorado quarterback ever to top the 500-yard mark. He threw more touchdowns Saturday (4) than Colorado did in six road games last season (3). Over the past three years, Colorado had been one of three Power 5 teams without a 300-yard passer.

• Hunter played 129 snaps and became the first Division I player in the past 20 seasons to have 100 receiving yards (he finished with 119 on 11 catches) and an interception in the same game. He also had three tackles and a pass breakup.

""We had some guys that singled themselves out with their playing and their playing ability,"" Deion Sanders said. ""A lot of guys you doubted -- one of them from an HBCU -- I think he had 510 yards passing in a Power 5 football game. And he happens to be my son, and I'm proud of him, tremendously.""

Hunter, the former five-star recruit who was one of the first to buy into Sanders' vision at Jackson State, wore a shirt with a montage of images from his coach's Hall of Fame playing career. Like Sanders, he took the same opportunity to say that none of this was unexpected.

""Football is football no matter who's playing. You got to go out there and dominate whoever's in their way,"" Hunter said. ""I went out there and dominated. A lot of people doubted me because I rated myself as No. 1 on the Heisman watch list. Now people are praising me. They didn't know what I could do. They've finally seen what I've seen, my vision and the coaches' vision for me.""

Deion Sanders agreed, saying he believes he has to promote his players.

""We had a couple of guys who should be a front-runner for the Heisman right now,"" he said. ""Who did that? Who did what they did today?""

All quarterback Shedeur Sanders did in his debut was set a Colorado record for passing yards in a game. Tim Heitman/USA TODAY Sports

Dylan Edwards, one of the jewels of Sanders' first Colorado recruiting class, for one.

The 5-foot-9, 170-pound freshman from Derby, Kansas, finished with 177 all-purpose yards and four touchdowns, becoming the first FBS freshman over the past 20 seasons with three receiving TDs and a rushing TD in his collegiate debut.

Sanders said he coached Edwards in youth football when the freshman was 7 years old, which led to the four-star recruit picking Colorado over offers from schools like Notre Dame, Nebraska, Oklahoma, Wisconsin and Oregon. In fact he decommitted from Notre Dame to sign with Colorado.

""Don't let the size fool you,"" Sanders said. ""Dylan looks in the mirror like 'Shallow Hal.' When he looks in the mirror he sees a 215-pound man that's probably about 6-4. That's the way Dylan addresses life.""

The Buffaloes also had four 100-yard receivers, a first in school history. Hunter and Edwards were two. The other two, Jimmy Horn Jr. (11 catches, 117 yards and a touchdown) and Xavier Weaver (6 catches, 118 yards) are transfers from South Florida.

It wasn't all so magical. The Buffaloes gave up 541 yards, surrendered an 86-yard kickoff return and had a field goal blocked. Shedeur Sanders missed two deep balls to Hunter by inches, and Hunter just missed what could've been another interception.

The grand experiment looked like the shot in the arm Deion Sanders promised when he was hired, snapping a 27-game road losing streak against top-20 opponents in front of 53,294, the largest crowd in TCU history. The hype is gone. The Coach Prime era has already changed the fortunes at Colorado.

""These young men in there right now, they believe,"" he said. ""Not all of them believed before. But right now, they came up one by one, two by two, and said, 'Coach, we believe.' Now they believe. Now Boulder believes, people in the front office, people in the building, the fans, the students, now everybody wants to believe. I'm good with that. We got room."""
252,2023/09/02, 'colorado tcu',https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap/_/gameId/401523994,"FORT WORTH, Texas -- — After nine months of hype, Deion Sanders had Colorado ready for prime time in his much-anticipated debut as Buffaloes coach.

Shedeur Sanders, the coach’s son, threw for a school-record 510 yards with four touchdowns — the game-winner a 46-yard catch-and-run by true freshman Dylan Edwards with 4:25 left —- and the Buffs pulled off an opening shocker with a 45-42 win Saturday over 17th-ranked TCU, last year’s national runner-up.

“A lot of you didn’t believe in us,” Shedeur Sanders said. “It’s crazy because you just got to understand our coach, Coach Prime, my dad, everywhere he went, he was a winner. Every game, every opportunity, he took advantage of.”

Deion Sanders came to Boulder, Colorado, to revitalize a long-dormant program, with an unprecedented roster flip.

Two-way star Travis Hunter, Edwards and Shedeur Sanders are among 87 newcomers at Colorado, which won only one game last season and has only two winning records since 2005.

Coach Prime, a two-time Super Bowl champion that included the last for the Dallas Cowboys 28 years ago, said when he first got the job he was coming to Colorado with luggage and it was Louis Vuitton.

Sanders practically named his son the starting quarterback before Shedeur even had a chance to enter the transfer portal, and was almost uncomfortably open about telling last year's CU players they should probably jump in, too.

Sanders' rebuild and a packed spring game at Folsom Field dominated the college football offseason.

But what would the team look like when the games started? Sanders already has a signature win as a three-touchdown underdog in his first game as a major college football coach.

“I’ve been talking about it and talking about it and you didn’t believe me,” he said.

Edwards caught three touchdown passes, including a 75-yarder in the opening minute of the second half when he turned another short pass into a big play. He also ran for another score.

Hunter, the former top recruit who came with the quarterback and coach from FCS school Jackson State, had 11 catches for 119 yards. As a defensive back, he had one of the two interceptions that TCU’s Chandler Morris threw in or near the end zone. He played over 120 snaps.

“They showed up. They were more ready to play than we were, think more excited to play, think they played harder,” TCU coach Sonny Dykes said. “It seemed like they had more determination down the stretch than we did. So against that’s a real credit to them. I think their coaching staff, they really did a good job getting them ready to play.""

Shedeur Sanders completed 38 of 47 passes and the Buffaloes had four 100-yard receivers for the first time ever: Hunter, Edwards (five catches, 135 yards), Jimmy Horn Jr. (11 catches, 117 yards with a TD) and Xavier Weaver (six catches, 118 yards). Colorado outgained TCU 565-541 total yards.

Morris was 24-of-42 passing for 279 yards and two touchdowns. Emani Baily ran for 165 yards. Trey Sanders had three TD runs, including a 1-yard run for a 42-38 lead two plays after Major Everhart’s 86-yard kickoff return.

Edwards' game-winning score came on a fourth-down play. He took a pass in the flats, made a slight hesitation and then raced down the sideline past the TCU defense.

TCU's final drive came to an end with a fourth-down stop around midfield, and Colorado, playing its final season in the Pac-12 before returning to the Big 12 to share a conference with the Horned Frogs, was able to run out the final minute.

Colorado didn't trail until Morris threw a 23-yard touchdown to Dylan Wright to put TCU up 28-24 with 2 1/2 minutes left in the third quarter. But that was the first of six consecutive possessions when the two teams traded touchdowns until Edwards' final score.

The Horned Frogs had an undefeated regular season last year in Dykes' first season, and reached the College Football Playoff, beating Michigan in the semifinal game before a 65-7 loss to Georgia.

They have now lost three of their last four games, going back to the Big 12 championship against Kansas State.

“I told the guys afterwards, if we play like that this year, we’re not going to win many football games. So we’ve got to get a lot better,” Dykes said. “Thought our tackling was really, really bad defensively. We've got a lot of guys back, those guys have tackled. I don’t know what happened today that they couldn't tackle.”

RUNNING ONTO THE FIELD

Deion Sanders spent much of the summer getting around on a scooter with a protective boot covering his left foot after multiple surgeries to remove blood clots and address issues with his toes. He took off the boot this week, and led his team onto the field for the opener.

Asked how his foot felt after the game, the coach responded, “Not good, not good. But I’m thankful. And God gave me what I needed to finish. I’m thankful that I finished. That’s all we want to do is start and finish.”

Sanders occasionally sat on a folding chair on the sideline during the game.

Sanders got postgame treatment on his foot before addressing his team or the media. While in the training room, he got a visit from his sons: Shedeur and safety Shilo, who had 10 tackles.

“We had a dad moment. They were really happy, elated,” the coach said “I'm proud of both of them, I really am.”

UP NEXT

Colorado: Six months after 50,000 people were at the spring game on a snowy April day, the Buffs play their home opener with Deion Sanders on Saturday against Nebraska (0-1) and new coach Matt Rhule. It’s only their third meeting since 2010, the last season both teams were in the Big 12 together.

TCU: The Frogs are home next Saturday night against FCS team Nicholls (0-1).

The believers are back in Boulder. It took just one week for the Colorado Buffaloes and Coach Prime Deion Sanders to make a statement on the college football national stage. Led by his son Shedeur Sanders’ 510 passing yards and 4 TD passes, the Buffaloes stampede offense rolled up 565 yards and 29 first downs to upset TCU 45-42.

Leading online sportsbooks FanDuel and BetMGM’s college football odds had Colorado as a 21-point underdog at kickoff and the Buffaloes were +740 on the moneyline to win the game.

The TCU Horned Frogs entered the opening game ranked No. 17 in the AP Top 25 poll after making it to the national championship game last year before losing to Georgia.

Betting on the Buffaloes

At the leading online sportsbooks, Colorado vs TCU was the most bet college football game on Saturday. And the bettors got the best of the bookmakers this time as Colorado was among the top-3 most bet teams of the day as a huge underdog of 20.5 to 21 points.

The game total was also among the top-3 bet over/unders of the day. The total opened 58.5 many weeks ago and closed at 63.5. The game easily sailed over the total with 87 points scored.

FanDuel communications sent over the betting data and updates on Colorado.

Colorado now has 8% of bets and 4% of handle to win the National Championship

Colorado’s odds to win the national championship are now +30000 after sitting at +40000 just prior to the TCU game.

Two-way star Travis Hunter has 17% of bets and 16% of handle to win the Heisman. His odds to win the Heisman Trophy dropped from +30000 to +10000 (100/1).

QB Sheduer Sanders has 16% of bets and 16% of handle to win the Heisman. His Heisman odds dropped from +20000 to +150000.

“I really think we have a couple guys that should be front runners for the Heisman right now,” Sanders said in his post game press conference. “That’s how I feel. Who did what they did today?”

To further illustrate the changes in Colorado after more than 70 players were replaced from last year’s 1-11 team, the Buffalos started last season 0-5 straight up (SU) and against the spread (ATS) as underdogs of +14 to +28 in each game. TCU beat Colorado 38-13 in last year’s season opener. Colorado was 1-11 SU and 2-10 ATS last year, and the Buffs are now 1-0 SU/ATS to kickoff the 2023 season with what will be one of the biggest point spread upsets of the entire season.

Colorado Highlights vs TCU

Beyond the shocking upset was some sensational stats and plays by Colorado’s rising stars.

Junior QB Shedeur Sanders completed 37-of-48 passes for 510 yards and 4 touchdowns without an interception. Shedeur became the first player in Colorado history to throw for over 500 yards.

Freshman RB Dylan Edwards caught three touchdowns, including a 75-yarder in the opening minute of the second half. His 46-yard catch and run for a TD with less than five minutes remaining was the game winner. Edwards also ran for a TD to give him four touchdowns in his college debut.

Two-way starter Travis Hunter had 11 catches for 119 yards. As a defensive back, the sophomore also had a key interception and played more than 140 total snaps on offense and defense.

Junior WR Jimmy Horn also had 11 catches for 117 yards and senior WR Xavier Weaver added 6 receptions for 118 yards.

The Buffalos rushed for just 55 net yards on 34 attempts as QB Sanders was sacked four times. TCU rushed for 262 yards including 164 yards on 14 attempts by Emani Bailey.

Hunter, Edwards and Shedeur Sanders lead an entirely new roster after new head coach Deion Sanders cleaned house following the Buffaloes 1-win season last year. Sanders hired former Kent State head coach Sean Lewis as Colorado’s offensive coordinator, and it looks like he’s engineering another electric and exciting offense. Coach Prime’s quick rebuild is trying to produce just the third winning record for the Buffaloes since 2005. Colorado is competing in the Pac 12 for the last time before moving to the Big 12 next season and playing TCU more often as a conference rival.

What’s next for Colorado?

The Buffaloes return to Boulder and a Week 2 clash with former rival Nebraska. Folsom Field will be surrounded by a full house of more than 50,000 fans waiting for Ralphie the Buffalo to run wild and Coach Prime to unveil college football’s most talked about team in their home opener.

Run Ralphie Run

FanDuel Sportsbook posted the opening line for Week 2 within an hour Colorado’s win over TCU, and Nebraska (-2.5) is a slight favorite. But bets and money have already come in on the Buffaloes, who are +1.5 within the opening hour of betting action.

Another rivalry awaits in Week 3 when Colorado hosts Colorado State with the Buffs taking the role as betting favorite for the first time. Then the Pac 12 conference schedule begins, and Coach Prime and his team move up in class with games at No. 15 Oregon followed by a home game versus No. 6 USC.

Colorado and Coach Prime will be answering critics all season long. But for Week 1, the Buffalos were Prime Time players in victory and bettors are likely to keep riding the Buffaloes until Ralphie stops running.

You can bet on it."
255,2023/09/03,'merkel cell skin cancer',https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/04/health/jimmy-buffett-rare-merkel-cell-carcinoma/index.html,"CNN —

Singer-songwriter Jimmy Buffett, who died September 1, had Merkel cell carcinoma, a skin cancer that’s diagnosed in fewer than 3,000 people in the US every year.

Skin cancer is the most widespread form of the disease in the United States, according to the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention, but Buffett’s death may be the first time people have heard of Merkel cell carcinoma. The condition was named for German scientist Friedrich Merkel, who first described that type of cell in 1875.

Merkel cells are thought to be a kind of neuroendocrine cell found at the base of the surface of the skin, the epidermis. They’re close to the nerve endings in the skin that let you feel a light touch.

Merkel cell carcinoma happens when something makes them grow out of control. Although scientists don’t fully understand what causes it, they believe the cancer is connected to UV light exposure, a weakened immune system due to disease or age, and the Merkel cell polyomavirus (MCV), which is found in nearly all the tumors of this cancer.

Nearly everyone gets MCV as a child, but it doesn’t cause any symptoms. The virus was discovered in 2008.

﻿Merkel cell carcinoma typically shows up on a person’s face or neck or in other areas that are often exposed to the sun, like the arm. It can also be found in places like inside the nose or esophagus.

It looks like a raised red or purple lump or pimple, unlike melanoma, another serious form of skin cancer that shows up as a dark spot.

A Merkel cell carcinoma may be mistaken for a cyst, but cysts can be painful while these spots often are not.

Buffett, who was 76, had been living with the cancer for four years, according to his official website.

If it’s caught early enough, the chance of living at least five years after diagnosis is pretty good – about 75%, according to the American Cancer Society – but if it has spread past the skin, likelihood of five-year survival dips to 24%.

Although rare, it is the second most common cause of skin cancer death after melanoma, according to the National Cancer Institute. It can be so deadly because it grows and spreads quickly, and it often can come back after treatment, usually within two or three years of diagnosis.

Men are twice as likely to develop this cancer than women. About 90% of the people who have it are White, and about 80% are 70 and older. The risks may be related to how much sun damage a person has had over their lifetime, the American Cancer Society says.

Because so few people have had this form of cancer, research is limited, and it is difficult to know exactly how to fight it. The American Cancer Society recommends that people who have Merkel cell carcinoma at any stage try to enroll in a clinical trial so they will have access to the latest treatments.

If the cancer is in an early stage, doctors will probably do a biopsy of the suspicious spot and then surgically remove the spot and some of the tissues around it. They may also do a biopsy of a nearby sentinel lymph node to detect whether the cancer has spread. The American Cancer Society says cancer is detected in the lymph nodes of 1 in 3 people who have Merkel cell carcinoma.

Doctors may also try chemotherapy and/or radiation, depending on the stage. Patients may get immunotherapy, medicine that helps their body destroy the cancer cells.

There’s no good way to prevent MCV, the common virus linked to Merkel cell carcinoma﻿, but there are good ways to protect yourself from this cancer.

Early detection is key. Examine your skin every month, and get a regular checkup from a doctor. The American Academy of Dermatology offers free skin cancer screenings across the country every year.

Boosting your immune system may help prevent cancer, the CDC says. Get proper sleep, avoid drinking too much, avoid smoking, maintain a healthy weight, eat a healthy diet, and get regular exercise.

There’s also a lot you can do to protect yourself from damaging ultraviolet (UV) rays. Never use a tanning bed. When you’re outdoors, stay in the shade as much as possible, and wear protective clothing, a hat and sunglasses, the American Cancer Society says.

Get CNN Health's weekly newsletter Sign up here to get The Results Are In with Dr. Sanjay Gupta every Tuesday from the CNN Health team.

Children should also stay covered up and wear sunscreen. Babies younger than 6 months should be kept out of direct sunlight, since skin damage can accumulate over time, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Even on overcast or cold days, be sure to wear sunscreen on your face. Many lotions and makeup have some form of UV protection.

The US Dermatological Association suggests wearing water-resistant sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.

If you’ll be in direct sun, the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit consumer advocacy group that has spent more than a decade testing sunscreens, recommends lotion sunscreens over sticks. Apply enough to fill a shot glass – about an ounce – every two hours while you’re in the sun."

The ""Game of Thrones"" star and Jonas wed again in a lavish ceremony that took place at the picturesque Château de Tourreau in the south of France, according to Elle.

Turner shared a glimpse into the wedding days later when she posted a black and white photo of the couple during their recessional to her Instagram page, writing ""Mr and Mrs Jonas"" in the caption.

Maise Williams, who co-starred in ""Thrones"" alongside Turner, reportedly served as her Maid of Honor, and Jonas's brothers and bandmates Nick and Kevin were also present at the French soiree.

GEHA Field at Arrowhead Stadium (Kansas City) WHEN: 8:20 p.m. ET | NBC, NFL+





The Kansas City Chiefs have dominated the NFL spotlight the past five years, winning two Super Bowls and making the conference title game or better every season. They also enter the season attempting to win their eighth straight AFC West title.





The last time the Detroit Lions had a period of that caliber dominance? The late 1950s. They last won their division in 1993, then known as the NFC Central.





So why are the Lions being featured in such a marquee slot against the defending Super Bowl champs on Thursday night? Because ever since the league announced this seasonâs schedule, itâs been clear that the NFL is betting that the Lionsâ hot streak down the stretch in 2022 portends good things for the long-woebegone franchise.





Itâs a big bet. Andy Reid and the Chiefs are 40-9 at Arrowhead Stadium with Patrick Mahomes. And though the Chiefs could be without two of their biggest stars in the opener, itâs arguable this is the Lionsâ highest-profile game since their last postseason contest: a wild-card loss to the Seahawks in Jan. 2017.





How will Dan Campbellâs team handle the spotlight? Can the Lions' rebuilt defense slow down Mahomes and Co.? Or will the Chiefs do to the Lions what they did to the Texans in the 2020 kickoff game, scoring 31 straight points en route to a laugher?





Here are four things to watch for when the Lions visit the Chiefs on Thursday night:

260,2023/09/03, 'burning man',https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/03/us/burning-man-storms-shelter-sunday/index.html,"Editor’s Note: Find the latest Burning Man festival coverage here.

CNN —

Thousands of people remain trapped at the Burning Man festival in the Nevada desert after heavy rains inundated the area and created thick, ankle-deep mud which sticks to campers’ shoes and vehicle tires.

Attendees were told to shelter in place in the Black Rock Desert and conserve food, water and fuel after a rainstorm swamped the area, forcing officials to halt any entering or leaving of the festival.

“A little over 70,000 people,” remained stranded Saturday, Sgt. Nathan Carmichael, with the Pershing County Sheriff’s Office, told CNN Sunday morning. Some people have left the site by walking out but “most of the RVs are stuck in place,” he said.

On Sunday morning, event organizers said roads remained closed as they were “too wet and muddy” and more uncertain weather was likely on the way. While some vehicles were able to leave, others got stuck in the mud, organizers said on the event’s website.

“Please do NOT drive at this time,” they added. “We will update you on the driving ban after this weather front has left the area.”

The remote area in northwest Nevada was hit with 2 to 3 months’ worth of rain – up to 0.8 inches – in just 24 hours between Friday and Saturday morning. The heavy rainfall fell on dry desert grounds, whipping up thick, clay-like mud festivalgoers said was too difficult to walk or bike through.

A death at the festival that was confirmed by authorities on Saturday was “unrelated to the weather,” Burning Man organizers said Sunday night.

Emergency personnel responded to a call for service regarding a 40-year-old man Friday but could not resuscitate him, organizers said, without providing further details.

The Pershing County Sheriff’s Office earlier said it is investigating the death.

Playa is the term used to describe sunken dry lake beds in deserts where water evaporates rather than running off, and even a small amount of rain can quickly soak a large area.

The rainy conditions forecast over the area for Sunday afternoon had mostly passed to the east of the festival site, according to a social media post from organizers, though there is still a chance of showers and thunderstorms “for the rest of daylight hours” into the evening.

Event organizers announced earlier Sunday plans to burn the Man – the huge totem set on fire at the festival’s culmination – on Sunday night if weather allowed.

However, the burn was rescheduled for Monday night “due to rain and muddy conditions Sunday, and an inability to move heavy equipment and fire safety onsite,” organizers said.

How long this could last

“We do not currently have an estimated time for the roads to be dry enough for RVs or vehicles to navigate safely,” Burning Man organizers said in a Saturday evening statement. “Monday late in the day would be possible if weather conditions are in our favor. It could be sooner.”

Organizers noted the rain falling on an already saturated playa overnight and Sunday “will affect the amount of time it takes for the playa to dry.”

For now, the gate and airport into Black Rock City remain closed and no driving is allowed into or out of the city except for emergency vehicles, the organizers said on social media. Black Rock City is a temporary metropolis erected annually for the festival and comes complete with emergency, safety and sanitary infrastructure.

The rain “made it virtually impossible for motorized vehicles to traverse the playa,” the Pershing County Sheriff’s Office said, noting people were advised to shelter in place until the ground has dried enough to drive on safely.

Vehicles trying to drive out will get stuck in the mud, Burning Man organizers said Saturday. “It will hamper Exodus if we have cars stuck on roads in our camping areas, or on the Gate Road out of the city,” the organizers added.

“If you are in BRC, please shelter in place & stay safe,” organizers said.

Storms and heavy rains across Nevada flooded other parts of the state and may have led to another death. In Las Vegas, authorities found a person unresponsive and “entangled with debris,” on Saturday morning who is believed to be “a drowning victim,” according to Jace Radke, a spokesperson for the city. An investigation is ongoing, Radke said in a news release.

Difficult conditions, but some stay positive

Some festivalgoers hiked miles on foot in the thick mud to reach main roads while others stayed at their camps, hoping for conditions to improve.

Hannah Burhorn, a first-time attendee at the festival, told CNN people were trudging through the mud barefoot or with bags tied around their feet.

“People who have tried to bike through it and have gotten stuck because it’s about ankle deep,” Burhorn said. The mud is so thick it “sticks to your shoes and makes it almost like a boot around your boot,” she added.

It’s unclear exactly how many people are stranded at the festival, but typically more than 70,000 people attend the weeklong event. It’s being held from August 28 to September 4 this year.

There weren’t any reports of injuries as of Saturday afternoon, Sean Burke, the director of emergency management for Pershing County, told CNN.

Amar Singh Duggal and his friends managed to leave the festival after hiking about 2 miles in the mud, he told CNN. He estimated it took them about 2 hours to get to a main road where they arranged to be picked up and taken to Reno, about a 120-mile drive from the event grounds.

“We made it, but it was pure hell (walking) through the mud,” Duggal said. “Each step felt like we were walking with two big cinder blocks on our feet.”

Among those attending the festival was DJ Diplo and comedian Chris Rock.

Rock posted a video on Instagram of thick mud and Diplo posted a series of videos in which he said a fan offered him and Rock a ride out of the site.

The DJ said they walked several miles and were able to get to a nearby airport.

Meanwhile, attendees who typically dedicate their time to making art and building community are now also focused on rationing supplies and dealing with connectivity issues.

“There is super limited bandwidth and a lot of people at the camp (are) trying to cancel flights and arrange for extended time here” due to the weather, Burhorn told CNN via text message from a Wi-Fi camp.

Still, the poor conditions have not stopped the creativity, said Burhorn, who had traveled from San Francisco.

“People are building mud sculptures,” she said.

Andrew Hyde, another attendee stuck at the Burning Man, said despite the muddy conditions making it difficult to walk, the weather has taken the meaning of the event back to its roots.

“You come out here to be in a harsh climate, and you prepare for that,” Hyde told CNN’s Paula Newton. “So in many ways, everybody here just kind of made friends with their neighbors and it’s a community event.”

Morale at the event is OK and there’s generally no panic among the attendees, Hyde said, describing music returning overnight.

There are worries about the additional rain causing delays, however, and the unknowns of worsening conditions.

“I think the concern is if we have another rain,” he said. “People need to go back to their jobs, back to the responsibilities they have back home.”

Assistance brought in

Organizers announced Saturday night they’ll be putting mobile cell trailers in different positions, configuring the organization’s Wi-Fi system for public access and deploying buses to nearby Gerlach to take people who might walk off the playa to Reno.

“This is not likely a 24-hour operation at this time,” the festival said in a statement on its website.

Organizers are also resourcing four-wheel-drive vehicles and all-terrain tires to help ferry medical and other urgent situations to the blacktop.

There have been people who managed to walk to a main road and were waiting for transport from the festival organizers Saturday night, the Pershing County Sheriff’s Office said.

Resources have been brought in from around northern Nevada to help people with medical needs on the event grounds, the sheriff’s office said.

“Burning Man is a community of people who are prepared to support one another,” Burning Man said on its website. “We have come here knowing this is a place where we bring everything we need to survive. It is because of this that we are all well-prepared for a weather event like this.”

“We have done table-top drills for events like this,” organizers added. “We are engaged full-time on all aspects of safety and looking ahead to our Exodus as our next priority.”"
261,2023/09/03, 'penn state football score',https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap/_/gameId/401520169,"Get ready as the Penn State Nittany Lions and their fans roar again at Beaver Stadium in 2023.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- — With a mere flick of his wrist, rocket-armed Drew Allar began a new era in Happy Valley.

This is what the 6-foot-5, 242-pound quarterback’s teammates and coaches gushed about all summer. The sophomore signal caller can make it look easy.

Allar, who sat behind five-year starter Sean Clifford last year, threw for 325 yards and three touchdowns in his first career start to help No. 7 Penn State beat West Virginia 38-15 on Saturday night in their season opener.

“That’s the Drew we saw in preseason camp. That’s the Drew we saw in limited reps last year,” coach James Franklin said. “He was extremely poised.”

KeAndre Lambert-Smith caught two touchdown passes — including a 72-yard dart that required very little windup from Allar, even though he was scrambling through the pocket when he launched it downfield. The ball soared over a lunging Mountaineer defender and fell perfectly into Lambert-Smith’s hands. The wideout didn’t even need to hit full speed to finish the scoring play.

Nick Singleton added a rushing touchdown, Malik McClain caught a touchdown pass midway through the fourth quarter for the Nittany Lions, who pulled away after leading 14-7 at halftime.

Backup Beau Pribula ran for a touchdown with six seconds left and kicker Alex Felkins added a 25-yard field goal.

It was the first time the two regional rivals played since meeting every year from 1947 until 1992. Penn State won all but six of those games and, with a deep, experienced roster that expects to contend for the Big Ten championship and more left little room for the Mountaineers to err in the opener.

Penn State outgained West Virginia 405-198 through three quarters. Meanwhile, a swarming defense forced four punts and three turnovers on downs.

Still, the Big 12 foes played hard after making the 184-mile trip north to Beaver Stadium. Quarterback Garrett Greene accounted for 233 total yards and CJ Donaldson scored on a short run to tie it at 7 early in the second quarter.

Singleton powered in from two yards out to give his team the lead for good two possessions later and Allar and his receivers helped Penn State pull away. He mimed a crisp fake handoff before hitting a wide-open Lambert-Smith in the end zone from 12 yards out to complete Penn State’s first possession of the second half.

From there the Mountaineers ran out of steam until Greene plunged in from a yard out with 3:34 to play. He hit Donaldson for a 2-point conversion to cap the scoring.

“I have no doubt we will bounce back,” West Virginia coach Neal Brown said. “We are onward and upwards.”

SPREADING THE WEALTH

Allar spread the ball around to nine targets.

“This summer was huge for us,” Allar said. “I think it really paid off with all the work that we put in and through fall camp and (KeAndre) had a really good game tonight and so did a lot of receivers.”

NEW BOOT

After starting kicker Sander Sahaydak missed field goals from 34 and 38 yards in the first half, Franklin opted to switch kickers for the Nittany Lions’ third PAT try and all kicks thereafter. Felkins was perfect with three PATs and the lone field goal.

THE TAKEAWAY

West Virginia: Greene played relatively mistake free but didn’t get a lot of help from his receivers who caught just 10 of 18 targets. Meanwhile, the Mountaineers’ defense hung in as good as it could. A similar effort might be pretty solid against teams with fewer weapons than the Nittany Lions.

Penn State: There is a lot of excitement in Happy Valley and for good reason. Allar checked all the boxes in his first start. He went 21 for 29, while Lambert-Smith looked every bit a No. 1 receiver. Meanwhile, star tailbacks Singleton and Kaytron Allen picked up where they left off last year and moved piles all night with 137 combined offensive yards.

262,2023/09/03, 'arsenal',https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/671065,"Mark Ogden says his biggest takeaway from Arsenal's win over Man United is how far ahead of both Manchester City are.

Goals deep in stoppage time by record signing Declan Rice and Gabriel Jesus earned Arsenal a sensational 3-1 victory over Manchester United in the Premier League on Sunday.

It looked as though both sides would have to settle for a point after United had a late goal disallowed and Arsenal had a penalty overturned, but Rice sent the home fans into delirium as he opened his account with a deflected shot in the 96th minute.

Jesus then wrapped it up with a sublime finish after a counter-attack with United having committed everyone forward.

""I think I controlled it with my chin and just had a shot, if you don't shoot you don't score,"" Rice, who arrived from West Ham United, told Sky Sports.

United were left crestfallen especially as they had what they thought was a late winner scored by substitute Alejandro Garnacho ruled out for offside after a VAR video check.

Marcus Rashford gave United the lead against the run of play in the 27th minute, lashing home a shot after a counter-attack, but their joy did not last long though as Martin Odegaard fired Arsenal's equaliser less than a minute later.

Arsenal were awarded a penalty midway through the second period when Kai Havertz went down in the area but referee Anthony Taylor changed his mind after checking the VAR monitor.

Mikel Arteta's side have 10 points along with three other clubsafter four games, two behind leaders Manchester City.

United are in 11th place on six points after already losing twice. ""Everything went against us but I thought the performance was alright,"" United manager Erik ten Hag said, adding that he disagreed with the decision to disallow Garnacho's goal.

""I didn't see that as offside but it is what is. It was such small margins today."""
263,2023/09/04,'smash mouth',https://www.nytimes.com/2023/09/04/arts/music/steve-harwell-smash-mouth-all-star-dead.html,"Steve Harwell, the former lead singer of the rock band Smash Mouth, which was best known for its 1999 hit “All Star,” died on Monday. He was 56.

His death, at his home in Boise, Idaho, was confirmed by the band’s manager, Robert Hayes, who said the cause was liver failure.

Smash Mouth was founded in 1994 in San Jose, Calif., and was made up of Mr. Harwell, the guitarist Greg Camp, the drummer Kevin Coleman and the bassist Paul De Lisle. Its first success came with the song “Walkin’ on the Sun,” from the band’s debut album, “Fush Yu Mang” (1997).

An upbeat track with a dark undertow, calling to mind both the Doors and contemporary ska-punk, “Walkin’ on the Sun,” with songwriting credits going to all four band members, went into steady rotation on MTV and topped Billboard’s alternative chart."
264,2023/09/04, 'steve harwell',https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/steve-harwell-smash-mouth-singer-dead-obituary-1234817636/,"Steve Harwell, who cofounded the band Smash Mouth in 1994, has died at the age of 56, band manager Robert Hayes confirmed. The musician, best known for hits like “All Star” and “I’m a Believer,” died at his home in Boise, ID “surrounded by family and friends.”

Harwell had been in hospice care following medical complications. The cause of death was liver failure, Hayes told Rolling Stone.

Hayes said Harwell “passed peacefully and comfortably.” In a statement to Rolling Stone, he offered a lengthy tribute to the artist, who was a staple of Nineties rock music and saw success with multiple albums and singles, selling more than 10 million albums with his band worldwide.

“Steve has been retired from Smash Mouth for two years now, and the band continues to tour with new vocalist Zach Goode,” Hayes said. “That said, Steve’s legacy will live on through the music. With Steve, Smash Mouth has sold over 10 Million albums worldwide-wide and topped the charts with two #1 hit singles, five Top 40 singles, three Hot 100 singles, four Billboard 200 albums and a Grammy nomination not to mention the hundreds of film and television placements and of course those musical features in Shrek.”

He continued, “Steve’s iconic voice is one of the most recognizable voices from his generation. He loved the fans and loved to perform. Steve Harwell was a true American original. A larger than life character who shot up into the sky like a Roman candle. Steve should be remembered for his unwavering focus and impassioned determination to reach the heights of pop stardom. And the fact that he achieved this near-impossible goal with very limited musical experience makes his accomplishments all the more remarkable. His only tools were his irrepressible charm and charisma, his fearlessly reckless ambition, and his king-size cajones. Steve lived a 100 percent full-throttle life. Burning brightly across the universe before burning out.”

While Harwell has not been an official member of Smash Mouth since 2021, he and bassist Paul Delisle are the only two original band members who had remained consistent through the majority of the group’s run. Editor’s picks

Harwell began his music career in San Jose, California as a rapper with the group F.O.S. (Freedom of Speech). After the group’s demise, he began working with his friend, drummer Kevin Coleman in 1990. Later, he teamed up with guitarist Greg Camp and bassist Paul Delisle. The four-piece issued two demos that garnered airplay at a local radio station. They soon performed at a summer festival alongside No Doubt and Beck.

Their debut album, Fush Yu Mang, arrived in 1997 via Interscope and spawned “Walkin’ on the Sun,” a Number One hit on Billboard’s Modern Rock Tracks chart that reached Number Two on the Hot 100 chart.

The band’s sophomore set, 1999’s Astro Lounge, incorporated more pop and was more musically diverse than its ska-influenced predecessor. It also spawned “All Star,” their biggest hit of their career. The song appeared in numerous film soundtracks, including the first Shrek movie and helped propel the album to triple-platinum status. Their cover of the Monkees’ “I’m a Believer” also appeared in 2001’s Shrek.

Harwell spoke of Astro Lounge’s new direction and had a message for the band’s detractors in a 1999 interview with Rolling Stone. “A lot of people said that we weren’t talented enough to do that type of shit. Well, we did it, and I want them to eat their words. We got slagged so much by people who wanted us to fail,” he said. “Even friends want you to fail. They’d get a good laugh if I fell flat on my face. We did this record to let people know, “Hey, don’t fuck with us. We built this team and nobody’s going to take it away from us.”

That same year, the band released a collection of early songs called The East Bay Sessions. Coleman left shortly after, citing back problems. Ex-Tripping Daisy drummer Mitch Marine eventually replaced Coleman on tour and on later albums.

The band dropped two more albums in the early aughts — 2001’s self-titled LP and 2003’s Get the Picture? They issued their fifth album, 2006’s Summer Girl on new label Universal following Harwell’s appearance on reality show The Surreal Life alongside Alexis Arquette, C.C. DeVille, Sherman Hemsley, Maven Huffman, Tawny Kitaen, and Andrea Lowell, with Florence Henderson serving as the house therapist.

Smash Mouth’s most recent full-length album, Magic, was released in 2012, the same year their book Recipes From the Road dropped. The band continued to tour as more members rotated in and out of the group.

While Harwell remained a mainstay, he was prone to onstage outbursts before ultimately leaving the group in 2021. At a Fort Collins, Colorado show in 2015, he reportedly became angry during the encore, yelled profanities, and exited after bread was thrown onstage. He later apologized. (In August 2016, Harwell reportedly collapsed and was taken away by ambulance while the band finished the set without him.)

But it was an incident in Oct. 9, 2021 that led him to retire from music. At the Big Sip festival in Bethel, New York, Harwell was captured on video slurring his words, threatening the audience, and giving the middle finger to fans. A rep for the singer told the New York Post at the time that his Wernicke encephalopathy, a neurological condition, impacted Harwell’s motor functions and memory.

“Steve has been dealing with long-term medical issues over the last eight years and during his last performance at the Big Sip stage, he suffered numerous symptoms directly linked with his current medical situation,” the rep said at the time. “As of today, Steve will be retiring from Smash Mouth to focus on his physical and mental health.”

NSYNC members Joey Fatone and Chris Kirkpatrick paid tribute to Harwell on Monday. “Known this dude for a very long time.. opened for NSync and even was my wedding singer at my wedding,” wrote Fatone on Instagram alongside an image of him and Harwell. “We had some good times ! Sad all things must come to an end and some times too soon due to things that are past fixing because too much damage has been done .. but let’s be real its never too late! Hopefully people out there that are dealing with addiction. get the right help that they need. Its a crazy world we live in now.”

In a separate social media post, Kirkpatrick said, “Rest easy my friend. I’m truly sorry for the difficult battle you had to fight. You were an amazing soul and will be deeply missed.”

To mark the 20th anniversary of “All Star” in 2019, Harwell addressed the enduring appeal behind the song for Rolling Stone’s oral history of the track. “All Star” was more than just an inescapable hit that flavored films and your favorite memes, it became part of the fabric of generations of music lovers for nearly a quarter century and continues to resonate.

“It was definitely a moment where other artists and people finally realized we’re not a bunch of punk kids. We write great songs and it’s iconic,” he said.

“The song just won’t go away because it’s just one of those songs,” Harwell added. “It’s like fucking Led Zeppelin ‘Stairway to Heaven.’ It’s like fuckin’ Lynyrd Skynyrd. You have certain songs that bands make that just don’t go away. We were blessed with that, and it was ‘All Star.’”"

266,2023/09/04, 'happy labor day',https://www.bangordailynews.com/2023/09/04/opinion/editorials/happy-labor-day-caution-uncertainty/,"The BDN Editorial Board operates independently from the newsroom, and does not set policies or contribute to reporting or editing articles elsewhere in the newspaper or on bangordailynews.com.

This newspaper recorded the events of Labor Day 1904 with unusual enthusiasm, describing a parade of more than 2,000 union members in Bangor as “filled with good-fellowship and triumph … a potent example typified in thousands of silent, stalwart men, of the strength and force and dignity which labor organization brings.”

In particular it admired the keynote address delivered by J.F. Sheehan of Massachusetts, who laid the groundwork for the development of unions.

“It is often said that the union men of America are discontented,” Sheehan said. “If this be so — and I deny it not — then it is a virtue and not a vice. The discontent that urges a man to rise above the lowly station where his lot is cast; that makes more money, better homes, nobler men and truer women; that has shortened the hours of labor and improved the scale of pay; that has given the United States the political liberty and social equality which it enjoys now; and which lastly, the trade unions of the land are going to ferment until it has equalized the scale between employers and employed until the American working man can stand up to all the world and say: ‘I am a man, with a man’s feelings and a man’s rights; I will be the faithful employ of any; but the unconsidered slave of none’ — this discontent, I say, must be hailed as a glory rather than as a sin!”

Ever since President Grover Cleveland signed an act making the first Monday in September a legal holiday to honor America’s workers, Labor Day has been a holiday of conflicting themes, an odd mixture of the somber and the frivolous. Even 19th-century labor organizer Peter J. McGuire, credited with conceiving Labor Day, admitted the holiday designed to honor work was timed to “come at the most pleasant season of the year, nearly midway between the Fourth of July and Thanksgiving, and would fill a wide gap in the chronology of legal holidays.”

This Labor Day comes as Americans continue to grapple with an economy that continues to change after the COVID-19 pandemic. There are many good signs — labor market participation is at more than three-year high and unemployment remains low. Wages, especially for the lowest-paid workers, have grown in recent years. Inflation also has cooled while remaining above the Federal Reserve’s target rate.

Where workers work — in an office, at home or both — remains an open question for many employers. During the pandemic, many workers were sent home to prevent the spread of the virus. Some remote workers moved to Maine, spurring population growth. While many workers like the freedom of remote or hybrid work, many companies, including Zoom, are increasingly calling workers back to offices.

Given ongoing gaps between worker and employer expectations, unionization is on the rise. That has been on display across the state, including here. Last year, the Bangor Daily News voluntarily recognized a newsroom union.

ORLANDO, Fla. -- After Florida State wide receiver Keon Coleman put together a dominant performance in a statement win over LSU on Sunday night, he was asked what he was most grateful for after such a big game.

Coleman has been at Florida State for only a handful of months, after transferring from Michigan State in mid-May. But no one would know it just from watching how he fit seamlessly into an already strong offense. Coleman caught nine passes for 122 yards and three touchdowns in a 45-24 victory over the No. 5 Tigers that will only serve to heighten already sky-high expectations for No. 8 FSU this season.

""Really, just being thankful for the opportunity,"" Coleman said. ""Coach [Mike Norvell] saying yes to me and believing in me. I'm grateful for my teammates, getting to show them the hard work that we have been putting in the whole summer is paying off and getting to show a glimpse of what I can do, and not only me, just what our whole receiver room and the rest of the team can do.""

Norvell, sitting next to Coleman at the podium during the postgame news conference, turned to the wideout and said, ""I'm grateful for you saying yes too,"" eliciting chuckles from the large media contingent in the room.

Florida State already had returned a vast majority of its offense, including starting quarterback Jordan Travis, starting running back Trey Benson and starting wide receiver Johnny Wilson. But adding Coleman showed how much further Florida State can go with yet another playmaker on its roster.

Coleman made every play on the ball when it was thrown his way, including two contested catches, one of which resulted in a touchdown. Since the start of last season, Coleman has an FBS-best nine contested touchdown catches, and that ability alone is enough to elevate a team's passing game. His three receiving touchdowns on Sunday tied for the most in a game by a Florida State player over the past 25 years.

In a tightly contested first half, Coleman kept Florida State in the game with touchdown catches of 40 and 21 yards. But FSU trailed 17-14 at halftime thanks to a combination of penalties, mistakes and poor decision-making from some of its best players. Norvell settled his team down at halftime and told his offense, ""You will score every drive in the second half if you just go out there and focus on the little things, focus on the details.""

He was right. Florida State scored on each of its drives, to the tune of 31 points. Travis settled down and commanded the offense, while Coleman added his third touchdown catch early in the fourth quarter to put the game out of reach.

Travis finished with 342 yards passing, one rushing touchdown and a career-high four touchdown passes. He became the first FSU player with four passing TDs and one rushing score in a game since Jameis Winston in 2013 against Pittsburgh.

It was Florida State's largest win against a top-10 team since the Seminoles' 2013 national title run.

""That second half, that was a glimpse of what I think this team can do and where I think it can go,"" Norvell said. ""But there's a lot of things we're going to have to clean up.""

The game turned in the third quarter with a gamble on fourth down. With the score tied at 17, Florida State faced a fourth-and-2 from the LSU 42-yard line. Florida State went for it with a swing pass out to a wide open Lawrance Toafili, who went 41 yards. Travis scored on the next play, and the Seminoles went from there, gaining the confidence they needed to begin overpowering LSU up front.

After allowing nearly 300 yards in the first half, the Florida State defense settled in too by shutting down Tigers quarterback Jayden Daniels and the running lanes. The Noles finished with four sacks and held LSU to fewer than 200 second-half yards.

Norvell was not ready to make grand proclamations or statements afterward about where his team is headed. He knows the work involved. The program he inherited when he took over as coach in 2020 had a roster that he had to completely flip over. He has done that over the past four years through the transfer portal -- and it paid dividends Sunday night.

Coleman is just the latest transfer portal success story at Florida State, which has transfers who are starters across its two-deep, including Benson, Wilson, tight end Jaheim Bell and defensive standout Jared Verse. Patience was required to get Florida State to this point. Patience will be required after opening night too.

""That's one game. It was a first step, and it was a big step,"" Norvell said. ""You get a chance to be on this stage, you want to go play well. I don't think we played our best game, but I thought that second half, we were able to really finish the way that we wanted to. I'm proud of them for the way that they continued to battle, the way they showed resilience and who they are."""

The duo went public with their romance Monday at the final Los Angeles stop on Beyoncé’s Renaissance World Tour. A source tells PEOPLE that the relationship is “fun and uncomplicated” for the Kylie Cosmetics founder, 26.

“They have been seeing each other for six months now. He makes Kylie happy,” the insider shares. “He has his own life and understands that Kylie needs to prioritize her kids.”

“He is charming, very loving and protective of Kylie,” the source adds. “She likes that he is a private guy.”

Jenner was spotted packing on the PDA with the Oscar nominee, 27, at Monday's star-studded concert. In a video obtained by TMZ, the pair were seen kissing on multiple occasions as they enjoyed the concert together.

The Kardashians star and Wonka actor were also spotted chatting while standing in a box at SoFi Stadium. Jenner’s sister Kendall Jenner joined the pair, as the beauty guru laughed while Chalamet smoked a cigarette in a clip shared on social media.

Later that month, a Jenner source shared that ""Kylie is having fun. After years of back and forth with Travis [Scott], she just wants to date without any pressure.""

The source claimed Jenner and Chalamet — who has been romantically linked in the past to Lourdes Leon, Lily-Rose Depp and Eiza González — met earlier this year at an event in Europe. ""They have a lot to chat about,"" the Jenner source said at the time, adding that the actor ""is fun and charming.""

News broke in early January that Jenner had split from her rapper ex, with whom she shares 5-year-old daughter Stormi and 18-month-old son Aire.

In July, the 32-year-old rapper seemingly called out Chalamet in his song ""Meltdown."" He referenced the famed fictional chocolatier Willy Wonka, whom Chalamet plays in the upcoming film Wonka, in the new song and seemingly challenges Jenner to find another man as “hot” as him.

“Chocolate AP and chocolate the Vs got the Willy Wonka factory (Vs)/ Burn a athlete like it's calories, find another flame hot as me, bitch,” he sings in the track off of his album, Utopia.

Videos by American Songwriter

In December 2022, Dion revealed that she was diagnosed with Moersch-Woltman syndrome or stiff-person syndrome (SPS), an incurable neurological disease that can cause debilitating muscle spasms.

“She’s doing everything to recover,” said Claudette Dion, 74, in a recent interview. “She’s a strong woman.”

The condition affects the central nervous system, particularly the brain and spinal cord, according to the Stiff Person Syndrome Foundation. “Imagine a full-body Charley horse that stops you in your tracks,” reads a description on the foundation website. “Stiff person syndrome is a neurological disease with autoimmune features,” continues the description. “Symptoms include muscle spasms, hyper-rigidity, debilitating pain, and chronic anxiety. Muscle spasms can be so violent they can dislocate joints and even break bones.”

“It’s an illness we know so little about,” added Claudette. “There are spasms. They’re impossible to control. There’s little we can do to support her, to alleviate her pain.”

Dion’s sister Claudette previously said that despite working with “top researchers in the field,” there has been little improvement in her health and it is difficult to find the proper treatment for her SPS. Another sister of Dion’s, Linda, has also moved into the singer’s Las Vegas home as her caretaker.

“We can’t find any medicine that works, but having hope is important,” said Claudette. “I honestly think that she mostly needs to rest. She always goes above and beyond, she always tries to be the best and top of her game. At one point, your heart and your body are trying to tell you something. It’s important to listen to it.”

Dion, who has three sons, René-Charles, 22, and 11-year-old twins Nelson and Eddy with her late husband René Angélil, first revealed her SPS diagnosis in a video on Instagram on Thursday (December 8).

The 55-year-old singer revealed her condition, several months after canceling the remainder of her North American Courage World Tour earlier in 2022. “I’ve been dealing with problems with my health for a long time,” said Dion in a video message on her social media pages. “And it’s been really difficult for me to face these challenges and to talk about everything that I’ve been going through.”

She continued, “Recently, I’ve been diagnosed with a very rare neurological condition called Stiff Person Syndrome, which affects something like one in a million people. While we’re still learning about this rare condition, we now know that this is what has been causing all of the spasms that I’ve been having. Unfortunately, these spasms affect every aspect of my daily life, sometimes causing difficulties when I walk and not allowing me to use my vocal cords to sing the way I’m used to.”

Jenner's mom Kris Jenner was also in attendance at Bey's birthday show alongside Corey Gamble, so it's safe to say Chalamet is spending time with his rumored girlfriend's inner circle.

Kylie Jenner Through The Years

While Chalamet and Jenner have yet to comment on their relationship status, it appears they're still going strong since first making headlines in April.

In fact, E! News shut down rumblings of a possible breakup after speculation began to circulate online in August. So, this buzz-worthy outing to Bey's concert is further proof that they're still spending time together.

Prior to hanging out with Chalamet, Jenner was in a long-term relationship with Travis Scott, who she shares daughter Stormi, 5, and son Aire, 19 months, with.

And although Jenner and Scott have split romantically, a source previously told E! News that they remain united as co-parents.

Look, I know the importance of a good starting word. But I also get really bored with sameness. I feel grumpy when I have to eat the same thing several days in a row (which I often do anyway). I don’t like to do the same things every day or week. I dye my hair a different color and get my nails decorated with new designs nearly every month. I get inspired by change.

So despite the impracticality, starting Wordle with a random word adds another level of challenge that I enjoy. Instead of feeling the pressure to solve in six, I get satisfaction out of pulling off a win from behind.

The being said, this stressed me out a little. MUSIC was probably a poor choice because of the uncommon nature of some of the letters, but you probably know by now that I do love to knock out vowels. STEAD got me in the ballpark. I knew the S was also unlikely to be the last letter, so I tried an -ASH word. Unfortunately, that’s a very common letter pattern, and FLASH was the wrong guess. BRASH was a better guess, because it also knocked out TRASH and CRASH.

I don’t know why I guessed AWASH. I think I was hoping to get lucky.

That only left me with GNASH, the correct guess, and an accurate description of what I was doing near the end of this game."

The Los Angeles Lakers agreed to terms with free agent big man Christian Wood on Tuesday, wrapping up their offseason moves with about a month to go before training camp.

Wood tweeted that it had ""always been my dream"" to play for the Lakers. It turns out his dream coincides with the desires of L.A.'s most important player: Anthony Davis.

Sources told ESPN that Davis made it clear to the organization he wanted to have more support at center so he wouldn't have to play so much 5 during the regular season.

Davis was slotted at center in 99% of his minutes last season, according to Cleaning the Glass data. While Davis' performance in the middle earned him a three-year, $186 million contract extension this summer, the Lakers' strategy with Rob Pelinka in charge of basketball operations has been to partner with their stars as stakeholders in the process.

Davis' desire to spend more time at power forward was heard. (In addition to Wood, L.A. also signed 7-footer Jaxson Hayes.)

The 27-year-old Wood is the seventh new face on a team that finished eight wins short of the title last season, losing in a sweep in the Western Conference finals to the eventual champion Denver Nuggets.

And while there's something to be said for a few of the departing players -- Dennis Schroder's overall competitiveness, Lonnie Walker IV's playoff timing, Troy Brown Jr.'s role flexibility and Wenyen Gabriel's tenacity were all positive elements for last season's squad -- L.A. has seemingly improved while keeping its core untouched.

That was easier said than done: Pelinka and the Lakers had just the biannual exception worth $4.5 million, the full midlevel exception worth $12.4 million and veteran minimum contracts to offer.

L.A.'s summer, culminating with the Wood signing, presents a cohesive vision. The Lakers didn't make the same mistake of ill-fitting wholesale changes, as they did going into 2020-21. They didn't prioritize name recognition and experience over youth and athleticism, as they did going into 2021-22. They aren't still trying to make a three-star system work, as they did going into 2022-23.

They maintained continuity while adding players who theoretically mesh with the defensive-minded expectations that Darvin Ham put in place in his first year as coach. They added players who thrived in high-basketball-IQ situations in Miami (Gabe Vincent) and Minnesota (Taurean Prince).

They took a chance on a few young players with upside (Wood, Hayes and Cam Reddish). And they addressed the one glaring weakness of last season's team by adding shooting everywhere they could find it: Vincent shot 43% on catch-and-shoot 3s during the Heat's run through the playoffs, Prince hit 38.1% from deep last season, and rookie two-way signing D'Moi Hodge shot 40% from 3 for Missouri last season.

Because of the timing of Wood's two-year, $5.7 million agreement -- the deal includes a player option in Year 2 -- coming nearly two months after the team's previous transactions when it signed draftees Jalen Hood-Schifino and Maxwell Lewis, it might stand out more than the others.

The truth is, the most consequential moves the Lakers made were reupping their own stars.

In addition to extending Davis, they re-signed the young trio of Austin Reaves (four years, $56 million), D'Angelo Russell (two years, $37 million) and Rui Hachimura (three years, $51 million). That core helped L.A. go 18-6 through the end of the regular season, play-in tournament and first two rounds of the playoffs. Add a healthy and rejuvenated LeBron James for his 21st season, and there are plenty of reasons for optimism in Lakerland.

Wood could become a steal coming off a season in which he averaged 16.6 points and 7.3 rebounds while shooting 37.6% from 3 with the Dallas Mavericks. He could use the Lakers' platform the same way Malik Monk and Schroder did in recent seasons to reestablish value and gain an even bigger role if James or Davis miss any significant time because of injuries.

But if Wood, who, according to NBA Advanced Stats, finished last in individual defensive rating among Mavericks rotation players last season, doesn't fit within the Lakers' agenda of coming together to pursue the franchise's 18th championship, there's little at stake.

""If he's on his best behavior, it could be a good fit,"" a league front office source told ESPN. ""If he's not, well, you cut him.""

Wood joins a franchise that's been on a roller coaster since winning the 2020 Finals inside the NBA's Orlando bubble. Despite that title, a mix of injuries and underwhelming trades has prevented the LeBron era from being considered a smashing success.

Now, like any team with title aspirations, the Lakers hope their reinforced roster -- capped by their latest big man signing -- can stay healthy. Knock on wood."

Former NFL wide receiver Mike Williams has been taken off life support and remains responsive after suffering complications from an accident at work last month, per Nick Veronica and Jonah Bronstein of WIVB 4.

Williams was hit in the head with a beam while doing electrical work on Aug. 21 and suffered a laceration that later became infected, one of his friends told WIVB 4. He was hospitalized on Sept. 1 and placed into a medically-induced coma.

Williams was taken off a ventilator on Thursday ""but is surviving and remains responsive,"" Tierney Lyle, the mother of the former NFLer's daughter, told WIVB 4.

""We need prayer warriors to continue praying and spread the word,"" Lyle said.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers selected Williams in the fourth round of the 2010 draft out of Syracuse, where he ranks ninth in career receptions (133) and eighth in receiving yards (2,044). He's also tied with Marvin Harrison for second in receiving touchdowns (20).

He spent the first four seasons of his career with the Bucs before being traded to the Buffalo Bills in 2014.

In his four seasons in Tampa, Williams, who finished second in 2010 Offensive Rookie of the Year voting, caught 215 passes for 2,947 yards and 25 touchdowns in 54 games, posting at least 900 receiving yards during the 2010 and 2012 seasons. His best year came in 2012 when he caught 63 passes for 996 yards and nine touchdowns in 16 games.

In his lone season with the Bills in 2014, Williams caught eight passes for 142 yards and one touchdown in nine games. He was released before Week 17."

In a statement Tuesday afternoon, the airline blamed the ground stop, which lasted about an hour, on a software update.

""Earlier today a software update caused a widespread slowdown in United’s technology systems,"" the statement said. ""We briefly held aircraft at their destination airports and resumed normal operations around 12:45 p.m. CT.""

No airplanes in flight were affected, the airline said, adding that cybersecurity was not a factor.

The FAA confirmed the airline had asked for the ground stop.

United Airlines said earlier Tuesday it was holding aircraft because of a ""systemwide technology issue.""

The FAA said in a statement on X, formerly Twitter, at about 1:50 p.m. ET that the airline lifted the ground stop for flights in the U.S. and Canada.

About the same time, the airline said the ground stop had been lifted.

In a subsequent statement, it said: ""We have identified a fix for the technology issue and flights have resumed. We’re working with impacted customers to help them reach their destinations as soon as possible.""

It’s not the first time this year technological problems grounded commercial airlines in the U.S.

In January, departures for all U.S. flights were halted for several hours after the FAA experienced a computer outage.

The FAA said at the time the delays, which affected thousands of flights, appeared to have been caused by an issue in the Notice to Air Missions system, or NOTAM, which provides pilots with pertinent information they need to fly.

And in June, the FAA ordered a ground stop at Washington, D.C.-area airports because of problems with a communication system at a facility that controls air traffic in Virginia. Less than an hour after departures were stopped, flights to the area airports resumed, the FAA said."

NEW YORK -- As anticipated, 23-time Grand Slam champion Novak Djokovic will face a surging, joyful 20-year-old at the final tennis major of the year. But he'll do so one round earlier than expected. With a matchup against world No. 1 Carlos Alcaraz still looming in Sunday's final, Djokovic will first face Ben Shelton, the big-hitting, bigger-smiling American who took down two of the top-ranked U.S. men, Tommy Paul and Frances Tiafoe, in back-to-back matches in Arthur Ashe Stadium this week.

""I'm pretty pumped about the opportunity to go back out there and have the same feeling I have today against another really tough opponent,"" Shelton said after his four-set win over Tiafoe in the quarterfinals late Tuesday. ""I've been enjoying every moment on court, the interactions with the crowd and the tennis that's being played.""

The unseeded Shelton was not the name on the lips of U.S. tennis fans hoping to watch an American man contest a Grand Slam final -- in their home Slam, no less -- for the first time since 2009. But he's the last American man standing.

""I love to see American tennis going in a great direction and tennis in general going in a great direction,"" Shelton said. It's been two decades since Andy Roddick won here in 2003, the last American man to win a major, and this year, this Slam, seemed as good a time as any for someone to end that streak. The U.S. has eight players ranked in the ATP's top 50, and Taylor Fritz and Tiafoe, ranked Nos. 9 and 10 in the world, have been building toward a breakout run at a major.

On Tuesday, and for the first time since 2005, three American men played in the quarters in Queens -- including Fritz and Tiafoe -- but only Shelton, who is ranked No. 47 and seeking his first tour-level title, emerged.

Over the past week and a half, Shelton has been calm and confident in big moments like the pivotal third-set tiebreaker against Tiafoe that ended one of the wildest sets of the tournament. Tied at one set apiece, the third set opened with six breaks in the first eight games -- three from each player. In the tiebreaker, Shelton double-faulted, twice, at set point and then smashed a 105-mph forehand return to the corner and eventually won the breaker 9-7.

""It's one of my biggest weapons, my serve, so to lose two points the way I did was unfortunate and frustrated me,"" Shelton said. ""Down set point, I needed to let some of that frustration out. All set, I'd been so uptight about things, trying hard to hold serve. I'd gotten broken, broke back and had so much stress. I needed a release.""

That moment changed the momentum of the match for the final time, and illustrated what Shelton described as his mental growth 14 months into his professional career.

""I've done a good job of blocking out what's going on around me when I need to,"" Shelton said. ""When the point is playing, I don't hear or see anything. I'm just practicing in a park. That's been surprising to me, how calm I've been able to stay in the moment.""

Shelton's scorching forehands and nearly 150 mph serves have been the talk of the tournament. But against Tiafoe, another big hitter, he mixed up his serve speeds and shot selection to great success, especially late in the match. Afterward, he borrowed the championship celebration of his friend, sprinter Grant Holloway, who won his third straight 110-meter hurdles world title last month, and mimed answering a landline phone and then slamming down the receiver.

""It's like I'm saying I'm dialed in,"" Shelton said, adding that, yes, growing up in Atlanta, his family had a home phone ""just like that."" In the news conferences after his matches, Shelton similarly vacillates between narrow-eyed seriousness and youthful playfulness, a reminder he is contesting only his fifth major. He lost here in the first round last year in his first Grand Slam appearance.

A star in college tennis and the 2022 NCAA singles champion, Shelton tested the ATP tour waters last spring before leaving the University of Florida, where his father, Bryan Shelton, spent 11 years as head coach, to join the tour full time. (Bryan resigned in June to join his son.) He made a run into the quarterfinals at the Australian Open in January before losing to Paul and now is into his first Grand Slam semifinal, where he will attempt to stop Djokovic's drive toward a record-tying 24th major title.

""I think whenever you play someone for the first time, someone who's been in this situation so many times and you know how rock solid the guy is, and mentally and physically tough, that's something I have to game plan for,"" Shelton said ahead of Friday's match. ""I also think it's an advantage with my game style to play someone who's never played me. I'm going to try and bring some things to the table that are different and hopefully disrupt him.""

Of course, that is no easy task against a player who's done his fair share of work to keep American players from hoisting major trophies. Djokovic has won 30 straight matches against Americans, his most recent in straight sets over Fritz in the quarterfinals. But in Shelton, Djokovic faces a young lefty with nothing to lose and a mounting fan base.

When asked if he might also have an advantage because he has had more of an opportunity to study Djokovic's game since he's been on tour nearly as long as Shelton's been alive, the Gainesville, Florida, resident didn't flinch. ""The way things are on tour with technology, you can watch so much film on the people you're playing,"" Shelton said. ""It's a pretty even playing field."""

Ben Shelton pulled off an upset against fellow American and world No. 10 Frances Tiafoe in four sets in the US Open quarterfinals early Wednesday.

Shelton – the youngest American male to reach a US Open semifinal since a 20-year-old Michael Chang made it in 1992 – will next play 23-time grand slam winner Novak Djokovic on Friday.

“I feel like I left it all out here tonight. Emotional battle,” Shelton said after the match. “Thanks to all you guys for staying so late. Hell of an atmosphere, and thanks for pushing me over the line.”

“Sometimes you got to shut off the brain, close your eyes and just swing,” Shelton said on the third-set tiebreaker. “Maybe there was a little bit of that, down a set point, but it ended up working out.”

With the victory, the 2022 NCAA singles champion Shelton will move from No. 47 and into the top 20 in the men’s world singles ranking.

Shelton was asked if he knew who he would face next.

“Yeah, he’s won 23 of these or something like that,” Shelton said about Djokovic. “It doesn’t get much better than that. It’s been tough the last two matches. I’ve been playing Americans, but hopefully you guys bring it for me two nights from now.”"
279,2023/09/06, 'hurricane lee',https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/10/weather/hurricane-lee-path-sunday-climate/index.html,"CNN’s continuing coverage of Hurricane Lee and Monday’s forecast can be found here.

CNN —

Hurricane Lee has strengthened back into a Category 3 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, satellite pictures and data from a hurricane hunter plane indicated Sunday.

The powerful storm, which has fluctuated in intensity throughout its time over the open Atlantic, is expected to become a very dangerous Category 4 by late Sunday or early Monday morning, according to the National Hurricane Center.

“Dangerous surf and rip currents have begun to reach portions of the southeast (United States) East Coast and are forecast to worsen and spread northward along much of the US East Coast during the next couple of days,” the National Hurricane Center said in an update Sunday.

Lee is forecast to slow down considerably as it moves well north of Puerto Rico, the British and US Virgin Islands and the northern Leeward Islands, but it will have an impact there and on other Caribbean islands. It remains too early to determine its long-term track for later this week and how significant the impacts could be for northeastern US states, Bermuda and Atlantic Canada.

By midweek, Lee will make a turn to the north, eventually moving between Bermuda and the US East coast late this week.

The East Coast is bracing for the same kind of large swells and rip currents that the Caribbean is facing now.

“Swells generated by Lee are affecting portions of the Lesser Antilles,” the National Hurricane Center warned Friday night. The British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispaniola, the Turks and Caicos Islands, the Bahamas and Bermuda also face swells this weekend that can bring life-threatening surf and rip conditions.

Waves breaking at 6 to 10 feet were forecast for Sunday, according to the National Weather Service office in San Juan, Puerto Rico. Larger waves were expected this week along east- and north-facing beaches.

“Beach erosion and coastal flooding is possible,” the office posted on social media.

Lee, which was a Category 1 storm Thursday, intensified with exceptional speed into Category 5 status as it moved west across the Atlantic, more than doubling its wind speeds to 165 mph in just a day.

Lee, which was a Category 1 storm Thursday, intensified with exceptional speed into Category 5 status as it moved west across the Atlantic, more than doubling its wind speeds to 165 mph in just a day.

Vertical wind shear and an eyewall replacement cycle – a process that occurs with the majority of long-lived major hurricanes – has since led to the weakening of the storm, the hurricane center said.

Hurricane Lee strengthened back into a Category 3 hurricane Sunday afternoon over the open Atlantic, and it’s starting to send dangerous rip currents to parts of the southeast US coast even as the storm’s longer-term path and effects are uncertain, forecasters said.

Lee, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph, was centered Sunday night over the ocean about 310 miles north of the Caribbean’s northern Leeward Islands and headed northwest, the National Hurricane Center said in an 11 p.m. ET Sunday advisory.

The powerful storm, which has fluctuated in intensity throughout its time over the Atlantic, could become a Category 4 by Monday morning before fluctuating again later in the week, forecasters said.

It remains too early to determine Lee’s long-term track for later this week and how significant the impacts could be for northeastern US states, Bermuda and Atlantic Canada.

But the storm already was generating swells that were affecting many of the far eastern Caribbean islands as well as the British and US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, Hispanola, the Turks and Caicos, the Bahamas and Bermuda. Those swells could cause life-threatening surf and rip currents, the hurricane center said Sunday.

And “dangerous surf and rip currents have begun to reach portions of the southeast US East Coast and are forecast to worsen and spread northward along much of the US East Coast during the next couple of days,” the hurricane center said in the 11 p.m. ET Sunday advisory.

The storm grew larger – though not stronger – Sunday evening. Hurricane-force winds extended up to 75 miles from center by 11 p.m. ET, the hurricane center said – up from 45 miles six hours earlier.

By midweek, Lee is expected to make a turn to the north, likely moving between Bermuda and the US East coast late this week.

Differing scenarios on Lee’s impact

Computer model trends for Lee have shown the hurricane taking a turn to the north this week. But exactly when that turn occurs and how far west Lee will manage to track by then will play a huge role in how close it gets to the US.

Several steering factors at the surface and upper levels of the atmosphere will determine how close Lee will get to the East Coast.

Lee's potential track next week will be determined by multiple atmospheric factors including a strong area of high pressure to its east (yellow circle) and the jet stream (silver arrows) to its west.

An area of high pressure over the Atlantic, known as the Bermuda High, will have a major influence on how quickly Lee turns. A strong Bermuda High would keep Lee on its current west-northwestward track and slow it down a bit.

As the high pressure weakens this week, it will allow Lee to start moving northward. Once that turn to the north occurs, the position of the jet stream – strong upper-level winds that can change the direction of a hurricane’s path – will influence how closely Lee is steered to the US.

Scenario: Out to Sea

Track Scenario: An area of high pressure (yellow circle) to the east of Lee and the jet stream (silver arrows) to the west of Lee, can force the storm to track between the two, away from the US coast.

Lee could make a quick turn to the north early this week if high pressure weakens significantly.

If the jet stream sets up along the East Coast, it will function as a barrier that prevents Lee from approaching the coast. This scenario would keep Lee farther away from the US coast but could bring the storm closer to Bermuda.

Scenario: Close to East Coast

Track Scenario: An area of high pressure (yellow circle) to the east of Lee and the jet stream (silver arrows) to the west of Lee, can force the storm to track between the two, closer to the US coast.

Lee could make a slower turn to the north because the high pressure remains robust, and the jet stream sets up farther inland over the Eastern US. This scenario would leave portions of the East Coast, mainly north of the Carolinas, vulnerable to a much closer approach from Lee."
280,2023/09/06, 'zach bryan',https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/country-star-zach-bryan-arrested-police/story?id=103016994,"A police report obtained by ABC News sheds light on the circumstances surrounding country music star Zach Bryan's arrest in Oklahoma.

Bryan's private security was in an SUV and Bryan was driving a pickup truck when the SUV was pulled over for allegedly speeding Thursday evening, according to the police report.

The SUV driver pulled over for the traffic stop in Craig County, and Bryan then pulled up next to the SUV, the report said.

A few minutes later, Bryan got out of the pickup and walked over to Oklahoma Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Bertram. Bryan allegedly said he was ""wondering what is taking so long,"" the report said.

""Bertram informed the male that he needed to get back into his truck to which he did not comply,"" the report said. ""For a second time Bertram told the driver to get back in his truck and that he is interfering with his police duties and that if he did not comply that he would be going to jail.""

Bryan responded saying, ""I'll go to jail, let's do it,"" according to the police report,

Country music star Zach Bryan was arrested in Oklahoma on Thursday, Sept. 7, 2023, for obstruction of an investigation, according to online records from the Craig County Sheriff's Office. Craig County Sheriff's Office

""At that time, Bertram removed his handcuffs and placed the male under arrest,"" the report said.

While in handcuffs, according to the police report, Bryan told the officer he wasn't doing anything wrong.

Bryan also allegedly told the trooper that ""arresting him is 'why people do not like police officers,'"" according to the report.

Bryan allegedly told the trooper ""that if he would let him out of the handcuffs that he would get back in his truck while also stating 'If you don't, it is going to be a mistake sir. I promise,'"" according to the report.

Bryan then said, according to the report, ""This is the second time this has happened in three days. These f------ cops are out of control.""

Bryan asked if he could call his dad to pick up the truck, the report said.

Bryan's father allegedly spoke with Bertram ""again asking about the arrest and was informed that the phone was on speaker and that there would be no assumption of privacy for any statements made,"" the report said. Bryan's father also allegedly said ""he would be calling the Governor,"" the report said.

Bryan was arrested for obstruction of a law enforcement officer, the report said.

In a nearly five-minute video on social media, Bryan took responsibility for the incident and said he was ""mouthing off"" and acted like an ""idiot.""

""I pray everyone knows I don't think I am above the law,"" he said.

In his video posted on social media, Bryan said the handcuffs were placed too tight.

""[The Trooper] was like, 'They aren't supposed to be comfortable,' you know, he was just being a cop,"" Bryan said.

In the video, Bryan said he had a prior run-in with law enforcement three days prior and said he was put in handcuffs for allegedly not giving his address to a police officer who stopped him. Bryan was able to move on without incident during that encounter, he said.

Bryan currently has the No. 1 song in America, ""I Remember Everything,"" a duet with Kacey Musgraves, according to the Billboard Hot 100 chart."
281,2023/09/07,'danny masterson',https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/live-updates/danny-masterson-sentencing/?id=102933801,"The ""That '70s Show"" actor was found guilty on two counts of rape in a retrial.

Former ""That '70s Show"" actor Danny Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison on Thursday after he was convicted of raping two women.

A Los Angeles jury found Masterson, 47, guilty of two counts of forcible rape in May during a retrial of a case involving three women.

Masterson will serve two 15-year sentences consecutively, one for each charge. He must also register as a sex offender.

The third count against Jane Doe No. 3 was declared a mistrial and has since been dismissed after prosecutors said they would not retry Masterson on the rape charge.

Masterson pleaded not guilty to three counts of felony rape following accusations by three different women, including a former girlfriend. The alleged attacks took place between 2001 and 2003.

At the start of the probation and sentencing hearing, Judge Charlaine Olmedo denied the defense's motion for a new trial.

Olmedo allowed the three Jane Does in the case to give victim impact statements at the sentencing -- the two he was convicted of raping, as well as the third whose count was dismissed.

In emotional remarks, Jane Doe 1 called for a life sentence for Masterson and said she wished she had reported him to police sooner. Jane Doe 2 said she forgave Masterson and his ""sickness is no longer my burden to bear.""

In a statement read on her behalf in court, Jane Doe 3 thanked the judge for giving her a chance to ""use my voice"" and said she was given her own life sentence of several debilitating ailments, including anxiety.

Masterson's defense attorney Shawn Holley asked the court to sentence him to 15 years to be served concurrently, as opposed to consecutively, saying that 15 years to life would be fair. She noted that Masterson had no criminal record prior to these incidents and has a young daughter.

Masterson did not speak at his sentencing hearing. His attorney continued to maintain his innocence on Thursday.

""The errors which occurred in this case are substantial and unfortunately, led to verdicts which are not supported by the evidence,"" Holley said in a statement. ""And though we have great respect for the jury in this case and for our system of justice overall, sometimes they get it wrong. And that's what happened here.""

Deputy District Attorney Reinhold Mueller called the sentencing a ""long time coming.""

""I'm very happy for the victims because this is a day that they've been looking forward to and they got their justice,"" Mueller told reporters after the hearing.

Mueller said one key part of the case was getting the jury to look past the time since the incidents took place.

""Just because it's a delayed report, even if it's been 20 years, it still matters, crime still happens, and somebody needs to be held accountable despite the length of the time,"" Mueller said.

The first trial ended in a mistrial in November 2022, with the jury deadlocked and unable to reach a verdict. The three alleged victims were members of the Church of Scientology, as is Masterson. All three women said they were initially hesitant to speak to law enforcement because they said church teachings discouraged reporting to police. The women eventually left the church.

One woman claimed the actor shoved a pillow into her face in 2003 while raping her.

Another woman, Jane Doe No. 3, who was dating Masterson at the time, claimed he raped her in 2001 while she was asleep. She and Jane Doe No. 2 are also involved in a related civil case against Masterson and the Church of Scientology.

""[Jane Does 2 and 3] have displayed tremendous strength and bravery, by coming forward to law enforcement and participating directly in two grueling criminal trials,"" Boies Shiller Flexner LLP partner Alison Anderson, the attorney for the two women, said in a statement. ""Despite persistent harassment, obstruction and intimidation, these courageous women helped hold a ruthless sexual predator accountable today, and they are not stopping there. They are eager to soon tell the fuller story of how Scientology and its enablers tried desperately to keep them from coming forward.""

In his closing argument, defense attorney Philip Cohen told the jury the women may have ""tweaked or maneuvered"" their stories to bolster their case, and that they may be motivated by ""hatred, revenge or money,"" KABC reported. Shortly after the jury was dismissed to begin deliberations on May 17, the defense asked for a mistrial -- arguing that prosecutors spent too much of their closing arguments on the alleged drugging of the victims, according to KABC.

Olmedo denied the request, citing her ruling that prosecutors could argue the women were drugged because it was ""directly relevant to their ability to perceive the events of the charged incidents,"" KABC reported.

Masterson, who was arrested in 2020, said each of the encounters was consensual. ""That '70s Show"" was still on the air at the time of all three alleged rapes.

The Church of Scientology previously told ABC News that there's ""no policy prohibiting or discouraging members from reporting criminal conduct of Scientologists, or of anyone, to law enforcement. ... Church policy explicitly demands Scientologists abide by all laws of the land.""

Bijou Phillips, the 43-year-old daughter of The Mamas & The Papas frontman John Phillips, is no stranger to the tragedies of life - a fact that was made all the more painfully clear this week when her husband, Danny Masterson, was sentenced to 30 years behind bars for raping two women in 2003.

The actress looked completely shattered as she left the courtroom on Thursday - and she even wrote an emotional letter to the judge calling him an 'amazing father' who worked to 'shield younger actors from temptation' while begging for leniency.

The three-decade sentence comes three months after Danny was found guilty on two counts of rape following a dramatic, eight-day trial - and it also marked the latest in a very long line of bitter storms that the former socialite has had to weather over the years.

And, tragically, it seems that scandal runs very much in the family, as her famous sisters, One Day At A Time star Mackenzie (born 1959), and Wilson And Phillips singer Chynna (born 1968) have also had to deal with a great deal of controversy over the years.

She and her famous sisters, One Day At A Time star Mackenzie (born 1959) and Wilson And Phillips singer Chynna (born 1968), have all had their storms to weather

They're the daughters of John Phillips, who is seen with his bandmates Mama Cass, Denny Doherty, and Michelle Phillips in 1996

One of the most shocking was when Mackenzie revealed she had a incestuous sexual relationship for 10 years with their father, John, which began when she was 19.

As Danny begins his 30-year sentence, FEMAIL went ahead and laid bare the horrifying histories of Danny's wife Bijou, as well the tragedies that have befallen her sisters (seen together in 2022)

All three siblings have also battled drug addiction over the years. Two of them ended up in rehab to treat their narcotics abuse, while Chynna checked into a facility to help manage her 'distressing' anxiety.

Now Bijou, who was in foster care for years, faces a new challenge in her life: the reality of raising her child alone after her husband, That 70's Show actor Danny, 47, was slapped with a 30-year prison sentence.

A source told DailyMail.com afterwards that the devastation from her husband's horrific crimes being brought to light has left her a 'shell of her former self.'

They added that Bijou is trying to remain strong for the sake of their daughter, but feels like she is 'grieving a death.'

When Danny was first convicted back in May, Scientologist Bijou broke down in tears during an emotional courtroom outburst, and was left inconsolable as her husband was lead away in handcuffs.

At the sentencing hearing this week, she attempted to contained her devastation - but, at one point, was seen holding a handkerchief up to her face. On her way out of the courtroom, she tried to hide behind a friend, but her heartbreak was written all over her face.

Bijou Phillips: Glamorous socialite who used to party with the Hilton sisters - before marrying Danny Masterson

Bijou was born out of the union between John (seen with her as a baby in 1980) and his third wife, South African actress and singer Genevieve Waite

Bijou legally emancipated herself from her drug-addicted parents when she was just 14 after years of being in foster care. She's pictured here with foster father Derry and foster sister Rita

Bijou - who has been married to Danny since 2011 and shares daughter Fianna Francis with him - is a model, actress, socialite, and singer.

Her mother was John's third wife, South African actress and singer Genevieve Waite, but Bijou legally emancipated herself from her drug-addicted parents when she was just 14, The Guardian reported.

She was put in foster care at the age of about three 'because her parents were unfit' to look after her.

'They spent years and years fighting for custody, so I bounced around a lot,' Bijou wrote in a candid Instagram post in 2018.

She continued: 'When I was a kid separated from my parents, I remember my mother coming and wanting to take me and just wanting to go with her so much and screaming and crying and griping the door, I was dragged inside, it took two adults and the door closed.

'I didn't see her again for months. It's a pain I still feel and I look at my baby and can't imagine that happening to us.'

However Bijou, now 43 and the youngest of John's children (she was born in 1980), has happy memories from her time in foster care.

'My foster parents were so great... I'm still really close with my foster family and love them so much,' she said.

'I'm so lucky I had such loving and safe foster parents and such a wonderful place and house to live. A big reason why I know how to mother and parent is because of them.'

After her emancipation, the then 14-year-old left school and got her own apartment right near Fifth Avenue that was looked after by a housekeeper.

It was here that her 'wild child' party lifestyle took off - where she would take coke, ecstasy, and heroin, according to The Observer.

Her father checked her into rehab aged 17 after her friend died from a heroin overdose. She's pictured in 1997

In 2017, she was accused by her Bully co-star Daniel Franzese (far right) of 'homophobia, body shaming and physical abuse'

At that point, she was already a rising star in her own right, having kickstarted her career as a model at age 13 and appearing in a controversial Calvin Klein underwear ad.

'I was 14 years old. What was I supposed to do?' a then 21-year-old Bijou told The Observer in 2002, while reflecting on her party days.

'If you were 14 years old and able to live on your own in an apartment in New York City, and you got invited to all these clubs, and you got a bank account and you had a car service you could call so that you could go wherever you wanted... what would happen?'

Eventually her father encouraged her to get sober, sending her to rehab at 17 years old - following the heroin overdose death of her friend, socialite Davide Sorrenti, aged 20.

In 2017, she faced another scandal when she was was accused by her Bully co-star Daniel Franzese, who most famously played Damian in the Lindsay Lohan-led movie Mean Girls, of 'homophobia, body shaming and physical abuse' while filming the 2001 movie.

In a lengthy Facebook post, Daniel claimed Bijou had taunted him for his sexuality, twisted his nipple and kicked him in the back of the head on the set of Bully.

Phillips addressed Frazese's claim in a statement to TMZ. She said: 'I want to write to address what Daniel has said.

In 2017, it was revealed Bijou had undergone a lifesaving kidney transplant after secretly battling a rare condition for years. She's seen with her daughter in 2015

Danny was found guilty on two counts of rape back in May. He's seen with Bijou in November 2022

'I don't remember that time well, those years are a blur. I was a teenager and reckless in my behavior.

'I know Daniel to be a trustworthy and honest person, and to find out through social media that I was not the friend I thought I was to him made me so sad.

'I am so mortified by this behavior and have contacted Daniel and apologized to him privately.

'I am not and never have been homophobic. I have nothing but love for the LGBTQ+ community and Daniel.'

Also in 2017, it was revealed that Bijou had undergone a lifesaving kidney transplant after secretly battling a rare 'incurable kidney disease' for years.

After the star's successful surgery, her husband, Danny, took to Instagram to talk about his wife's journey and to thank the 'angel' who gave her 'the gift of an encore.'

He posted a black-and-white picture of Bijou and her donor holding hands across hospital beds, coupled with a caption that read, '100 per cent successful transplant. Now the real work begins.

'My lady has been slowing dying for the past seven years of an incurable kidney disease.'

Bijou and Danny, who met at a celebrity poker game in 2004, are both Scientologists, and their faith played a big part in his trial.

All three of the women who accused Danny of rape testified that that the reason they took so long to report him to the police was their fear of retribution from the Church of Scientology.

One of the women told the court that she was born into a family of Scientologists, and when she reported the rape to the church, a top official 'made it clear that Danny was untouchable.'

When Danny was first convicted in May, Scientologist Bijou broke down in tears during an emotional courtroom outburst

A source told DailyMail.com that Bijou is trying to remain strong for the sake of their daughter, but feels like she is 'grieving a death'

She said to Danny during the sentencing hearing: 'You are a true coward and heartless monster.'

Another told him: 'You are pathetic, disturbed and extremely violent and the world is a safer place with you in prison.'

Jurors found him guilty of raping two of the victims, but on the third charge, the jury was 'hopelessly deadlocked' at eight in favor of guilty and four in favor of not guilty.

A source told DailyMail.com after the sentencing that Bijou is devastated that her life with Danny has been 'completely uprooted,' and terrified about how this will impact her and their daughter.

'Currently Bijou is circling the drain and is filled with all the emotion and no emotion at all,' they said.

'She is a shell of who she has been. She is really trying to be strong for her daughter as she is trying to figure out life and what it will be like for her.

'It can only be compared to a divorce or a death for her not being able to be with Danny the way they were.

'They had their life, and it has been completely uprooted and changed and change is as scary and miserable as one would imagine.

'Friends are trying to be there for her, but things are really tough. She is really trying to figure it all out and what her life will be after all things are said and done.

'Whatever happens with Danny will change her life forever and, in a not so dignified word, it just sucks.'

In her letter to the judge, obtained by DailyMail.com, she wrote that she 'couldn't accept' that he sexually assaulted the women and called him a 'life-saving' partner who dedicated himself to farming to support his family when the accusations about him started to emerge and he lost his acting career.

She also noted Danny's aversion to drugs - a common principle of Scientology - and his apparent dedication to helping young actors escape the downfalls of wealth and fame.

Mackenzie Phillips: Bijou's half-sister claimed she had a 10-year incestuous relationship with Mamas & Papas frontman father John

Mackenzie made a bombshell accusation in her memoir, High On Arrival, that she and father John had a 10-year incestuous relationship. The pair are pictured circa 1981

Mackenzie said it began when her dad raped her when she was 19. She's seen with her dad and one of his wives, Genevieve Waite, in 1975

The daughter of The Mamas & The Papas frontman and his first wife, heiress Susan Stuart Adams, made the bombshell revelation in her memoir, High On Arrival, that she and father John had a 10-year incestuous relationship.

Mackenzie said it began when her dad raped her aged 19 - on the night before her wedding.

As her life began to spiral out of control due to drug use and partying, the sex became consensual and went on for almost a decade.

She also recalled how she became pregnant - but had an abortion after not being sure whether the baby belonged to her father or her then husband, Jeff Sessler, who had no idea about the secret affair.

Mackenzie also accused her father of introducing her to heroin when she was still a teenager, and said he once missed the vein when he tried to inject her with it, which turned her arm numb.

She said in her book that her father turned up on the eve of her 1979 wedding to Jeff - a member of the Rolling Stones entourage - determined to stop the marriage.

'I had tons of pills, and dad had tons of everything, too. Eventually I passed out on dad's bed,' she wrote.

'My father was not a man with boundaries. He was full of love, and he was sick with drugs.

'I woke up that night from a blackout to find myself having sex with my own father. Had this happened before?

'I didn't know. All I can say is it was the first time I was aware of it. For a moment I was in my body, in that horrible truth, and then I slid back into a blackout.'

Mackenzie (pictured with her mother, Susan Stuart Adam, who was John's first wife) said the sex became consensual and lasted for almost a decade

Mackenzie's constant drug use got her fired in the early 1980s from the US sitcom One Day At A Time. She's seen with her castmates Pat Harrington Jr, Valerie Bertinelli, and Bonnie Franklin

At the time of her book's release in 2009, the troubled actress, then 49, also spoke for the first time about her incest ordeal in an interview with Oprah Winfrey.

Mackenzie also told Oprah her father taught her to roll joints at 10 and she tried cocaine for the first time at 11.

Despite being raped as a teenager by her father while she was in a drug-addled stupor, she said the relationship eventually became consensual and lasted almost a decade.

'We're touring, and I begin waking up after drug-fueled events with my pants around my ankles and my father sleeping beside me,' she said.

'Again, [I thought]: ""Don't think. Don't look. Just keep going."" And this happened over time.

'It didn't happen every day. It didn't happen every week, but it certainly happened.'

She said she finally ended it after she became pregnant, and feared the baby might be her father's.

Mackenzie's constant drug use got her fired in the early 1980s from the US sitcom One Day At A Time.

In 2008, she pleaded guilty to possessing cocaine after she was arrested at Los Angeles International Airport earlier that year.

Airport police alleged she was 'carrying what appeared to be heroin and cocaine in baggies and balloons,' People reported at the time.

Last year she came out as bisexual, telling the Behind The Velvet Rope Podcast: 'Throughout my life have lived on both sides of the curtain'

Mackenzie considers her 35-year-old son, Shane (who she shares with ex Shane Fontayne), to be 'the love of my life.' The pair are pictured in 1995

As part of her plea, Mackenzie agreed to complete an 18-month drug treatment program.

The now 63-year-old has been married three times - to manager Jeff, guitarist Shane Fontayne, and The Who's conductor Keith Levenson.

But Mackenzie considers her 35-year-old son Shane (who she shares with ex Fontayne) to be 'the love of her life' - and they frequently bond by 'playing extremely complicated board games all weekend long.'

Last year, she came out as bisexual, stating on the Behind The Velvet Rope Podcast: 'Throughout my life have lived on both sides of the curtain.

'I've had boyfriends, I've had girlfriends, you know, throughout my life. I am neither one nor the other.'

Drawing from her own experiences with addiction, Mackenzie became a substance use counselor at LA treatment facility Breathe Life Healing Centers in 2016.

She's currently listed as the vice president of referral relations on the clinic's website.

Chynna Phillips: Bijou's other half-sister had her own battles with drug and alcohol addiction as a teen

Like her sisters, Chynna (pictured with her mom, Michelle Phillips, John's second wife, in 1987) had her own struggles with addiction as a teenager

Her mom was a member of The Mamas & The Papas. They're pictured in 1978

She said her lack of a relationship with her dad 'really impacted' her as a child. She's seen with her mother

Like her sisters, Chynna had her own struggles with addiction as a teenager.

The now 55-year-old was the result of a union between John and his second wife, Michelle, who was known as Holly Michelle Gilliam before her marriage and also a member of The Mamas & The Papas.

During her time on Dancing With The Stars in 2017, Chynna, a born-again Christian, revealed she had turned to drugs and alcohol to 'put a bandage on her emotions.'

'My relationship - or lack thereof - with my dad, really impacted me as a child. I had a lot of abandonment issues, and I just didn't understand why I couldn't have a father around like some of my other friends did,' she told TV Guide.

'At the time, everyone was keeping me from the big secret: that my dad had this drug addiction.

'I felt so hurt and scarred on the inside, that I ended up turning to drugs and alcohol as a teenager, to put a bandage on my emotions. I didn't know how to deal and that was just me trying to cope.'

After dropping out of school, she formed pop group Wilson Phillips with friends Carnie and Wendy Wilson in the 1980s. They had some success in the 1990s.

Chynna said she struggled with addiction as a teenager after being abandoned by her father. She's pictured with her husband, Billy Baldwin, in 2004

Later she stepped away from music to raise their three children - Jameson, Brooke and Vance, but she checked into rehab to treat her anxiety. Michelle described her anxiety as 'distressing'

Chynna said she eventually got her life together before meeting husband Billy Baldwin.

'It was perfect timing to have met such an amazing man. I met him when I was 23 and have been with the guy for 20 years,' she said in 2011. The couple married in 1995.

Later, she stepped away from music to raise their three children - Jameson, Brooke and Vance - but soon, life became too much for her and she checked into rehab to treat her anxiety in 2010.

At the time, her mother, Michelle, described her anxiety as 'distressing.' A source told People in 2010 'a combination of things' sparked her two-week rehab stint, with Michelle adding it had been 'a very tough year' for Chynna.

Months before, sister Mackenzie's memoir was released, making her years-long sexual relationship with her father, John, public.

The day before the book's release, Chynna had dropped her album, One Reason, and instead of talking about her music, she was asked about the sins of her father.

'That really overwhelmed her,' a friend told People.

During that same period, she headed on tour - the first time as a mother - something Michelle said was 'very trying for her.'"
283,2023/09/07, 'chiefs vs lions',https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/chiefs-vs-lions-time-tv-streaming-how-to-watch-key-matchups-odds-pick-for-2023-nfl-kickoff-game/,"The 2023 NFL season is finally here, and things will get started Thursday night with the Kansas City Chiefs kicking off their Super Bowl defense with a home game against the upstart Detroit Lions.

Kansas City enters the season favored to repeat as champions, while the Lions are among the most popular breakout picks and expected to make the playoffs for the first time in quite a while. We'll get to see two explosive offenses take the field on Thursday night, although these teams might look just a bit different than we thought they would, whether due to injury (Travis Kelce is out), suspension or contract-related issues.

Before we break down the matchup, here's a look at how you can watch the game.

How to watch Lions-Chiefs

When the Chiefs have the ball

In five career Week 1 games, Patrick Mahomes has completed 121 of 167 passes (72.5%) for 1,542 yards (9.2 per attempt), 18 touchdowns, and zero interceptions. According to Tru Media, he's averaged 0.55 expected points added (EPA) per dropback in those games -- a rate that would usually be more than twice as good as the typical league leader.

Year Opp Result Cmp Att Comp % Yards TD Int QB Rtg EPA/DB 2018 LAC W 38-28 15 27 55.6% 256 4 0 127.5 0.40 2019 JAC W 40-26 25 33 75.8% 378 3 0 143.2 0.67 2020 HOU W 34-20 24 32 75.0% 211 3 0 123.3 0.40 2021 CLE W 33-29 27 36 75.0% 337 3 0 131.4 0.56 2022 ARI W 44-21 30 39 76.9% 360 5 0 144.2 0.67 All Total 5-0 121 167 72.5% 1,542 18 0 136.9 0.55

Up against a Detroit defense that finished last season ranked 32nd in yards allowed, 28th in points allowed, 27th in FTN's DVOA and 31st in Tru Media's EPA per play, there is every reason to expect another monster performance. Except that we now have to consider what Mahomes has done with and without star tight end Travis Kelce, who hyperextended his knee in Tuesday's practice. Kelce is missing his first game due to injury since his rookie season, so obviously, Mahomes has played very few snaps without his top target on the field. Still, he has unsurprisingly gotten excellent results.

Kelce On Field Off Field Dropbacks 2960 305 Comp 1770 184 Att 2683 275 Comp % 66.0% 66.9% Yds 22001 1956 YPA 8.2 7.1 TD 178 14 INT 47 1 1D/Att 40.5% 34.9% Expl/DB 10.1% 8.2% AY/Att 8.3 6.2 QB Rtg 106.3 102.9 EPA/DB 0.26 0.18

Mahomes, naturally, ranks first in the NFL in EPA (expected points added) per dropback during the five-year period since he became Kansas City's starter. Of course, the 0.26 EPA per dropback he's averaged with Kelce in the game is the best mark of the past five years, but the 0.18 he's registered without Kelce would drop him all the way down to ... second best.

However, taking a few snaps here or there without Kelce during the course of a drive is much different than having to play an entire game (or a stretch of the season) without him. And eventually, the fact that Mahomes has thrown much shorter passes (6.2 air yards per attempt vs. 8.3), created fewer first downs (34.9% of attempts vs. 40.5%) and explosive plays (8.2% of dropbacks vs. 10.1%), and thrown for touchdowns less often (5.0% of attempts vs. 6.6%) with Kelce on the sideline than on the field would have a significant effect on Kansas City's offense.

If Kelce does suit up and play his usual complement of snaps, we should expect him to absolutely eat. Detroit's linebackers were uniformly awful in coverage last season, and on the type of intermediate passes that Kelce excels at catching, the Lions allowed the league's fifth-worst EPA per dropback. Adding Jack Campbell via the draft and Chauncey Gardner-Johnson via free agency should help in that department -- just, probably not enough to shut down Kelce, who is the NFL's most dangerous weapon in that area of the field.

In the unlikely event that Kelce is just totally blanketed, Kansas City has plenty of other ways for Mahomes to tear up a defense. They don't necessarily have a true No. 1 receiver, but the Chiefs do have multiple players who can excel in specific roles. Kadarius Toney is the best of the bunch, but he's likely to be limited to packaged plays in his return from knee surgery. Still, we saw in the Super Bowl how dangerous he can be even while playing limited snaps. Marquez Valdes-Scantling is the deep threat, Skyy Moore will work the slot, Justyn Ross can make contested catches, Rashee Rice can do the type of jet sweep and designed touches and Mecole Hardman did and even Justin Watson can be a threat on play-action passes.

The Chiefs have shown that as long as they can keep Mahomes upright with a strong offensive line, it almost doesn't matter who their receivers are. Their quarterback and their head coach (Andy Reid) are that good. Kansas City's offensive line is that good, too. They have arguably the best interior trio in the NFL (Joe Thuney, Creed Humphrey and Trey Smith), and while Donovan Smith and Jawaan Taylor have some question marks attached to them, they should be able to hold up well enough for Mahomes to do his thing. Detroit's pass rush was right around league average in terms of creating pressure last season (34.9% of opponent dropbacks compared to the 33.2% leaguewide rate), but struggled to turn pressure into sacks (17.4% vs. 19.3% average), which is an especially dangerous combination against Mahomes, who is second to none at creating outside of structure.

If the Lions can't find a way to manufacture pressure, they are probably drawing dead when it comes to stopping the Chiefs already. But that's especially true considering the weakness of their defense last season was actually in the run game, and the Lions didn't make any significant additions to their defensive front. The Lions allowed 2.03 yards per contact per carry last season, per Tru Media, the third-worst mark in the NFL. They also allowed 3.19 yards after contact per rush, the fourth-worst figure. With their power run game, the Chiefs checked in second in yards before contact per carry a year ago. That's not a good combination for the Detroit defense, which has its hands full in every area of this matchup.

When the Lions have the ball

The first and most important thing to note here is that the Chiefs will be playing this game without Chris Jones, who is by far their best pass-rush threat. That's particularly important because the Lions have a good offensive line whose weakness in pass protection is probably up the middle, where Jones does his work, and because there might not be a single quarterback in all of football whose performance drops off more when under pressure than Jared Goff's.

We saw this during his time in Los Angeles, and we have seen it again throughout his two years in Detroit. When throwing from a clean pocket, Goff has put up top-10 numbers leaguewide. Under pressure, he's collapsed to the bottom-10.

Goff Under Pressure Clean Pocket Clean Rank Pressure Pressure Rank EPA/Play 0.31 4 -0.45 27 Comp % 73.2% 8 46.6% 24 Yds/Att 7.6 18 5.8 23 TD % 4.9% 12 3.1% 26 INT % 0.9% 3 2.8% 9 QB Rtg 107.4 5 64.0 22

Without Jones, the Chiefs are obviously less likely to generate pressure on Goff. Last season, Kansas City's defense recorded a sack, hit or hurry on 37% of opponent dropbacks with Jones on the field, but only 29% of dropbacks with him on the sideline. That's a pretty significant difference. Without Jones and the suspended Charles Omenihu, it will largely be up to edge rushers George Karlaftis and Mike Danna, plus rookie Felix Anudike-Uzomah to create pressure on Goff. (Interior linemen Derrick Nnadi and Tershawn Wharton aren't big pass-rush threats.)

If and when Goff does have time to throw, we know who his top target will be: slot man Amon-Ra St. Brown. The Sun God is coming off his first Pro Bowl appearance after hauling in 106 receptions for 1,161 yards and six touchdowns last season. He lined up in the slot on 54% of his routes, according to Tru Media, and when he did so he was targeted on 28.8% of this routes, catching 61 of 83 passes thrown his way for 596 yards and a score. The Chiefs used multiple different defenders in the slot last season, with L'Jarius Sneed and Trent McDuffie filling that role at different times, and later in the season depending on the matchup. Whichever of them is tasked with defending St. Brown will have his hands full.

Things are a bit more up in the air for the Lions on the outside. At least until Jameson Williams returns from his six-game suspension, Detroit does not have a high-level threat outside the numbers. Marvin Jones, Josh Reynolds, and Kalif Raymond figure to get the most opportunities, but none of them should scare defenses all that much. Instead, the passing game will largely flow through St. Brown and a pair of rookies: tight end Sam LaPorta and running back Jahmyr Gibbs. Being that that trio of players consists of a slot receiver, a tight end and a back, it's likely that most of Detroit's targets will be short-area throws, so the Lions will need them to consistently create yards after the catch in order to make big plays. Linebackers Nick Bolton and Willie Gay, plus safeties Justin Reid and Brian Cook, will need to be at their best in the tackling department.

The Lions had success running the ball with a lot of different looks last season, and should again bring a varied run game to the table this year. How it will fare with a different pair of backs (Gibbs and David Montgomery in place of D'Andre Swift and Jamaal Williams) remains to be seen, but the line should block things up well enough for a duo that fits well together given their divergent body types and skill sets. Offensive coordinator Ben Johnson has shown he can scheme things up and put players in position to succeed.

Friends of Kanye West’s so-called “wife” have grown “extremely concerned” about the pair’s increasingly bizarre behavior, according to a new report.

Bianca Censori‘s pals are said to be worried about the couple as the Yeezy fashion designer has made it nearly impossible for them to contact his employee.

“Bianca is stuck, and her friends are trying to save her, but no one can because of the blockades Kanye has put up [around her],” a source described as a “close friend” told DailyMail.com Wednesday.

“Everyone is extremely concerned. This isn’t who she is. She is an incredibly outspoken and lively person who is never one to keep her mouth shut.”

The pal claimed Censori has “no one” in her life right now and added, “It is so scary.”

Last month, photos obtained by Page Six showed Censori, 28, and West, 46, engaging in NSFW behavior aboard a water taxi in Venice, Italy.

Following the apparent sexual act, the boat company, Venezia Turismo Motoscafi, banned the couple for life from using its services, saying, “We completely dissociate ourselves from such acts and behavior.”

However, West and Censori’s public-facing actions, which have included numerous shoeless outings, aren’t the only concerns her friends have expressed. In addition to their eyebrow-raising decisions, the fashion architect’s pals believe the Grammy winner is trying to transform her into his ex-wife, Kim Kardashian.

“Kanye is trying to make Bianca into a radicalized version of Kim — almost like Kim 2.0,” the source insisted.

“The difference is that when Kim was with Kanye, he was respected in the fashion world. He has since lost this respect.”

Reps for West and Censori didn’t immediately return Page Six’s requests for comment.

Over the past couple of years, the rapper-turned-designer fell from grace following a series of antisemitic rants and comments.

“I’m a bit sleepy tonight but when I wake up I’m going death con 3 On JEWISH PEOPLE The funny thing is I actually can’t be Anti Semitic because black people are actually Jew also You guys have toyed with me and tried to black ball anyone whoever opposes your agenda,” he tweeted in October 2022, which resulted in him being temporarily locked out of the social medium.

5 A source previously told Page Six that the Skims founder wants no part of West and Censori’s drama. kimkardashian/Instagram

As a result, numerous companies, including Adidas, cut ties with West.

Although the “Flashing Lights” rapper may have ideas of transforming his current “wife” into his ex, the Skims founder wants no part of it.

A source close to Kim, 42, told Page Six exclusively last week that the “Kardashians” star has “moved on” entirely from West, with whom she shares four children, and had “no interest” in communicating with Censori.

“She absolutely does not want to talk to her. Kim is actually a firm believer in letting people be on their own journey and figure out life,” the source explained.

“Kim has very much moved on. Kim only wishes Kanye and Bianca the best.”

Ye and the model had a non-legal wedding in January, less than two months after he and Kardashian settled their divorce."

NEW YORK -- Thousands Cash App and Square customers were unable to access their accounts or send money Thursday and early Friday due to system outages impacting both payment services.

Outage reports for both platforms picked up around the same time Thursday afternoon, according to data from outage tracker Downdetector. In the hours following, numerous customers took to social media to share error messages and frustrations about not being able to access their money.

“Since around noon PT (3pm ET) on Thursday, sellers have been unable to access accounts or process payments due to a systems outage within Square,” Square wrote on X, the platform formerly known as , shortly before 7am ET Friday. “We know you trust us with your business, and these situations add challenges to running your operations. For that, we are truly sorry.”

In a later update to its online status portal, Square said that its services were “steadily regaining their functionality” Friday morning.

Cash App similarly reported some service recovery Friday. As of around 7:30 a.m. ET, Cash App said that customers could once again add cash, make purchases with their Cash Card and buy Bitcoin. But not all services had fully returned yet.

“We're continuing to get the ability to send payments and cash out back up and running,” Cash App wrote on its status page Friday morning. On Thursday night, the payment service urged those experiencing issues to “not reattempt any actions such as sending and receiving payments.”

With the 2022 World Cup now behind them, Argentina's road to defending their title began on Thursday night. They hosted Ecuador in their first World Cup qualifier of this cycle, and as the match wore on, it became abundantly clear that the defending winners would need a hero.

And there's no prizes for guessing who that hero would inevitably be. Lionel Messi scored a stunning late free kick, lifting his side to a 1-0 win. Argentina were far from their best on this night, and Ecuador were more than good enough to contain them for large stretches. However, when one team has Messi in this kind of form, sometimes that's all it takes.

The Argentine captain wasn't the only standout, though. The attack, by and large, spluttered, but Argentina's midfield was as good as advertised. The trio of Rodrigo De Paul, Enzo Fernandez and Alexis Mac Allister have carried on momentum from last winter's World Cup and put in quite a shift to help their side to a win.

Jimmy Fallon has apologized to his colleagues over allegations outlined in a Rolling Stone story published Thursday about a difficult work environment at “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon,” CNN has learned.

During a Zoom call with staff of “The Tonight Show” held after the story published, Fallon reportedly said he did not intend to “create that type of atmosphere for the show,” according to a follow-up story by Rolling Stone, citing unnamed employees who were on the call.

CNN has reached out to representatives for Fallon.

An NBC representative referred CNN to the network’s statement printed in Rolling Stone’s original report.

“It’s embarrassing and I feel so bad,” the employees claim Fallon said, according to the Rolling Stone article.

“Sorry if I embarrassed you and your family and friends… I feel so bad I can’t even tell you,” the article quotes Fallon.

“I want the show to be fun, [it] should be inclusive to everybody,” Fallon also reportedly said. “It should be the best show.”

In the original story, 16 current and former employees described a difficult work environment at “The Tonight Show” that in some cases they say was detrimental to their mental health. The individuals were not identified by name in the story, citing fear of professional repercussions. CNN has not independently verified their claims.

Fallon and the “Tonight Show” did not provide comment for the first story, but a statement from NBC was included in the report.

“We are incredibly proud of The Tonight Show, and providing a respectful working environment is a top priority,” NBC’s statement read. “As in any workplace, we have had employees raise issues; those have been investigated and action has been taken where appropriate. As is always the case, we encourage employees who feel they have experienced or observed behavior inconsistent with our policies to report their concerns so that we may address them accordingly.”

In 2020, Fallon came under fire for a resurfaced clip from a “Saturday Night Live” sketch where he performed an impersonation of Chris Rock in which he appeared in blackface.

Fallon issued an apology after the clip of the sketch, which originally aired on “SNL” in 2000, resurfaced on social media and prompted criticism.

In recent weeks, Fallon has appeared on the “Strike Force Five” podcast with fellow late-night hosts John Oliver, Stephen Colbert, Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Meyers while their shows are dark amid the ongoing writers’ strike. The proceeds generated by the podcast will go to out-of-work staff from the hosts’ respective shows, they said."
290,2023/09/08, 'rouse',https://people.com/anthony-rouse-boy-killed-allegedly-by-stepfather-father-speaks-out-7967087,"Anthony Rouse loved the water, making it all the more tragic that the 6-year-old boy drowned to death, allegedly at the hands of his stepfather, according to police.

Before Anthony's death, he was a “really happy baby” who liked to go swimming and fishing, according to his father and foster mother, who both shared their memories with PEOPLE.



“He really liked the water, he liked to swim,” says Kasee Metzger, her voice cracking. “We took him to my mom’s house for his second birthday party because she has a pool and he really liked to swim and be around the water.”

Metzger, a schoolteacher who fostered Anthony for a few months when he was an infant, took pauses in between sharing memories days after the boy's biological mother and stepfather, Alize and Tre Seymore, were indicted on first-degree murder charges in connection with his April death.

As police investigated the case, they unearthed long-term abuse Anthony allegedly suffered at the hands of the Seymores, according to an affidavit PEOPLE reviewed.



The affidavit alleged Anthony was beaten and held captive in a dog cage, and that his siblings were bribed with “rewards” by the suspects to join in on the abuse.



Anthony died within several months of being in the custody of the Seymores.

Andre Rouse, Anthony’s father, who raised him for much of his last four years, tells PEOPLE his son was ""an energetic person.""

He loved to go fishing, just like his Andre, who works as a commercial fisherman. At the age of 1, Anthony accompanied him on a work trip on a boat.

“He’s caught a 25 pound stingray,” Andre recalls.

Now, four months after Anthony’s death, Andre remembers his last conversation with his son word by word.

Anthony’s last request was a birthday gift from his dad: “‘Daddy my birthday is coming up,’ and he told me he wanted a Nintendo Switch, and a lot of Paw Patrol games,” Andre recalls.

But the part of the conversation Andre remembers most is the difficult goodbye the two had when Andre told him he had to leave for a fishing trip, which sometimes takes him offshore for two to three weeks. When Andre told Anthony he needed to hang up, the child pleaded with him to not go — According to Andre, Anthony said, “C’mon Daddy, don’t do me like that. Let’s go fishing!”

By the time Andre returned from his fishing trip, Anthony was dead.

On April 22, police would respond to a 911 call at the Seymore residence; the couple allegedly told police Anthony died by suicide.

But police soon suspected otherwise: After the child was taken to two different hospitals, staff from both facilities raised concern after observing signs of possible long-term abuse, including scars.

Two days later, Anthony was declared dead.

Now, Andre is without a job, and his son's death has taken a toll on his mental health. He recently accidentally cut his finger because he couldn’t “stop thinking about this situation,"" he says.

“Nobody is prepared to lose a child like how I lost him,” he adds.



The Seymores are being held without a bond and facing a slew of charges including first degree-murder and child abuse.



It's not immediately clear if they have entered pleas or retained attorneys to comment.

American Coco Gauff has her chance at her first Grand Slam title in front of a home crowd, while Aryna Sabalenka -- the soon-to-be new world No. 1 -- will look to win her second major of the year. Who will win? We asked our experts:

What can Gauff do to defeat Sabalenka?

Pam Shriver: Gauff can beat Sabalenka by playing strong defense and making Sabalenka hit extra balls. Gauff's forehand needs to be able to withstand the extreme power of Sabalenka that will target Gauff's forehand side more than the backhand. Gauff's serve needs to get a free point per service game or even more. Gauff needs to orchestrate the crowd support to help her at times, and continue to realize she can win a major final even without her A-game.

Cliff Drysdale: Gauff needs to continue to play defensively, using her lightning speed, but will need to be more aggressive than in her previous two matches to avoid having Sabalenka dictate totally.

Alexandra Stevenson: Gauff has to keep the same practice tactics with her forehand. Her speed seems to always be there.

It's significant to understand what Brad Gilbert has done for Gauff with his old-school coaching. He doesn't use the new analytics. He uses his eyes. He's explained to her what ugly tennis really is -- and how you can win with it. She will have a new game plan for Sabalenka. Keep her movement and lift that forehand, so that Sabalenka can't hit into her far, far western grip. If she brings her focus, forehand and movement -- she should be in a good position to win. But don't forget the serve. She's got to make a high percentage of first serves.

Rennae Stubbs: Use her speed to get one more ball back. Use her forehand to go high to the Sabalenka forehand, but she must hit it with depth.

Alyssa Roenigk: Sabalenka essentially answered this question for us in Thursday's news conference after her semifinal win over Madison Keys. To be effective against the hard-hitting 25-year-old, Gauff needs to continue to serve well, utilize her speed, play loose and approach the match like she has nothing to lose. ""She's hungry. And she knows that the crowd is going to support her,"" Sabalenka said of Gauff. ""That's what makes her a really difficult opponent in this final.""

Bill Connelly: This has been an incredibly even series to date -- Gauff has won three of their five matches and seven of 13 sets, and two of the matches have gone to a third-set tiebreaker -- and within them the script for Gauff has been laid out pretty clearly.

In her three wins, she landed at least 64% of her first serves, and in her two losses, she landed 63% (a third-set tiebreaker loss in 2020) and 57% (a straight-set loss this year at Indian Wells). Plus, in two of her three wins, she won at least 57% of Sabalenka's second-serve points.

This all makes sense, of course: If Sabalenka is landing her big first serve, something she's done better in 2023, you either have to match her with some easier service points of your own, or you have to pounce on every second serve she gives you.

D'Arcy Maine: Everything the others have said here is exactly right -- Gauff's serve, and how she returns Sabalenka's serve, could be the keys to winning this match. She will need to bring everything she has to this final in order to hold off Sabalenka, but as Gauff certainly saw Thursday night, Sabalenka was bageled in the opening set against Keys. How did Keys do it? By seizing on Sabalenka's errors, hitting a seemingly never-ending barrage of winners and riding the momentum and energy from the crowd. Of course, Keys was unable to withhold Sabalenka's incredible comeback, but the match, and Keys' dominant first set, could provide some clues for Gauff and her team.

What can Sabalenka do to defeat Gauff?

Shriver: Sabalenka has the extreme power to target Gauff's forehand and disrupt the recently more confident forehand of Gauff, yet as we saw in the semis versus Karolina Muchova, Gauff can still break down in big moments.

Sabalenka can't panic when Gauff gets one, two or three extra balls in play. The Belarusian needs to walk out for the final at Ashe Stadium, accepting that the crowd will be 99 percent with Coco Gauff, and show very little emotion. Sabalenka might want to watch the last six games of Bianca Andreescu's final win over Serena Williams in 2019 and Ajla Tomljanovic's three-set win last year over Williams in Williams' final match to see two examples of non-American women winning on Ashe with an American as the heavy crowd favorite.

Sabalenka has a strong team behind her, and can use their energy and support to help block out the disparity of crowd support. She should remember how she won the Australian Open final this year by playing clutch power tennis, and believe that if she did it once in a major final, she can do it again.

Drysdale: Sabalenka needs only to dance with who she brought to this party. Use her power groundstrokes following a power serve.

Stevenson: Sabalenka has a lot to think about. Watch her serve mechanics. It was up and down against Keys. And she's holding in mental pressure about becoming No. 1. To her, she's supposed to win. Sabalenka has to cover the court -- and use her newfound net game to unbalance Gauff.

Stubbs: Hit through Gauff's forehand. Sabalenka can hit the ball flat enough to Gauff's forehand to get a short ball, then she can go to the open court.

Luke Jensen: Hit winners past the fastest player in women's tennis.

Roenigk: She's not going to beat her by playing the way she did against Keys. If Sabalenka comes out flat and bagels the opening set like she did Thursday night, Gauff will not let her back into the match. Gauff finally has the one thing that's been missing in big moments: belief she can win. If Sabalenka wants a second major title, she needs to make Gauff question that belief, and do it early. Attack her forehand, shorten points and force her into mistakes.

Connelly: When you're the (soon-to-be) No. 1 player in the world, typically the answer to ""How do you win?"" is: ""Play your game."" Her 6-4, 6-0 win over Gauff at Indian Wells, the only genuinely resounding win either has had in this series, was a Sabalenka master class: She hit aces on 12% of her serves, landed 73% of her first serves and never double-faulted.

Meanwhile, she won more first-serve return points (43%) than she ever has against Gauff. Granted, Gauff was in a bit of a ""can't win against top-10 players"" funk at the time -- she lost seven of eight between October and May -- and will almost certainly play better. But when Sabalenka is landing the big first serve and hitting big in general, she's the favorite against virtually anyone, even someone as good at defending as Gauff.

Maine: I'm no psychologist, but I have to think Sabalenka will enter this match with more confidence than ever after that improbable come-from-way-behind win over Keys. That self-belief and knowing the match isn't over until the very last point, combined with her experience from winning at the Australian Open in January, will all help her in terms of emotionally handling the final. As Alyssa pointed out, she will need to come out ready to play, and not flat like she did on Thursday. But if she does that, she certainly has more than a decent shot of securing her second major title.

Who will win?

Drysdale: Sabalenka, in three sets.

Stevenson: I'm sticking with Gauff -- even though choosing a woman in today's field requires definite consideration of mental and physical ability on the day of match. Unlike the other women players, Gauff doesn't put pressure on herself. She has shown she can change things up and get out of trouble.

Stubbs: Sabalenka. Her power will be too much for Gauff, and her experience will be the difference-maker.

Jensen: Gauff in straight sets. [New coach] Brad Gilbert has Gauff understanding her tactical identity and Gauff is in a destiny mindset ... a winning combo!

Roenigk: This is the summer of Gauff. Sabalenka might be the No. 1 player in the world come Monday, but Gauff is on an 11-match win streak, has already earned two titles this summer and has more hard-court wins than any woman in the world this year. Let's face it: She's on a collision course with destiny. Gauff wasn't meant to win her first Grand Slam at Roland Garros. She was always meant to do it in New York. If you believe in that sort of thing.

Connelly: Because I'm boring, I basically always pick the favorite. But there's barely a favorite! Caesars only gives Sabalenka a slight edge, and Tennis Abstract gives her a 51% chance of winning. Factor in Gauff's slight overall advantage in the series, and this is a virtual toss-up.

That makes me look for vibes, and Gauff's are off the charts at the moment. She's won 17 of 18 matches since Wimbledon, and five were against top-10 players. She's dropping anime references in post-match interviews. She's got the crowd in the palm of her hand. She's beaten the French Open champ (Iga Swiatek) and the Wimbledon champ (Marketa Vondrousova). She's beaten the French Open finalist (Karolina Muchova) twice. She's dropped a total of 11 games in the last two rounds.

Frankly, she's been the best player in the world over the past two months. There would be nothing surprising about a Sabalenka win, but give me Gauff.

Maine: This match has the makings of an instant classic between two of the best in the game right now, and what I believe most strongly is that it will be a competitive match filled with drama for all the right reasons. There are a million arguments to be made for both players but I'm going with Coco Gauff. With this New York crowd and having played so well on the hard court all summer long, this just feels like it's her time to win her first Slam."

KANSAS CITY, Mo. -- Count Andy Reid as among those surprised by the play of Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Kadarius Toney in Thursday's season opener.

Toney dropped a number of passes, including one that was intercepted and returned for a touchdown in Kansas City's 21-20 loss to the Detroit Lions. Toney also dropped a pass on the Chiefs' final drive that would have put them well past midfield.

""That's just not his thing,'' Reid said. ""He's not a guy that drops balls. He's got great hands, so we just got to keep working through it.''

Reid said Toney would play in Sunday's game against the Jaguars in Jacksonville.

""The only way we're going to get him back is by playing him,'' Reid said. ""I think you'll see better as we go down the road here from him.''

Kansas City acquired Toney at midseason last year in a trade with the New York Giants. He made some big plays during the regular season, then, in the fourth quarter of the Chiefs' Super Bowl win over the Eagles, scored a touchdown and returned a punt 65 yards to set up another.

The Chiefs were hopeful as training camp began that Toney could be their top wide receiver but he tore his meniscus in the minutes before the first practice was to begin. Toney had surgery and missed all of camp and the preseason, returning only a few days before the Lions game.

""I thought him getting in the game was important, but to be fair I've got to kind of look in the mirror on that one,'' Reid said, taking the blame for Toney's play against Detroit. ""I probably didn't put him in the best position there because he doesn't drop the ball. That's just not his deal. He's a very, very secure catcher ...

""I thought it was important that he got in the game, got caught up on the speed, but I probably put him in bad positions there, especially later in the game. He's still getting his legs back and all that.''

Kansas City is hopeful tight end Travis Kelce can play against the Jaguars. Kelce injured his right knee in practice last week and sat out against the Lions.

""Travis is getting better,'' Reid said. ""He's progressing. We'll see how he does the rest of today and tomorrow, and then we'll go from there.''"
294,2023/09/08, 'olivia rodrigo',https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20230907-how-pop-star-olivia-rodrigo-became-a-defining-voice-of-gen-z,"Guts has already signposted Rodrigo’s musical growth by yielding a transatlantic number one single, Vampire, which begins as a hushed piano ballad before building into a mini rock opera. Rodrigo has said she was inspired by 1990s female artists ""who aren't afraid to be angry and remorseful and like spiteful and snarling,"" you can definitely hear this when she crisply eviscerates an ex for ""bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire"".

The album's other trailer single, Bad Idea Right?, is driven by a chugging guitar riff that nods to the 1980s new wave era, but Rodrigo's vocal delivery is coolly contemporary. When she repeatedly asks whether reconnecting with an ex is a ""bad idea, right?"" before swearing and saying ""it's fine"", it comes off as funny and relatable. She also displays her flair for a pithy lyric on Get Him Back, a hooky pop-rap track that sounds like a future single. ""He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye,"" Rodrigo deadpans drolly. ""He said he's 6ft 2 and I'm like, 'Dude, nice try'."" ""The key to Rodrigo's songwriting is her ability to tell a great story in a way that feels like a conversation or as if you're reading her diary,"" says Daly, who also praises the singer for penning lyrics that capture ""how people of her generation speak"".

Like her blockbuster debut album, 2021's Sour, which went four-times platinum in the US, Rodrigo crafted Guts with producer Dan Nigro. Rodrigo isn't the only Gen Z superstar with a go-to collaborator – Billie Eilish writes almost exclusively with her brother Finneas – but this partnership still feels noteworthy given that many modern pop hits are polished to a high sheen by larger songwriting teams. Rodrigo explained in an interview with Zane Lowe for his Apple Music show how she loves working with Nigro, who has also written with Lewis Capaldi and Caroline Polachek, among others, because he ""cares enough"" to tell her when she can do better. As she recalled, after she played Nigro an early version of Drivers License, the stunningly intimate ballad that would become her breakthrough hit, he told her: ""Yeah, that's great, but you need to, like, finish the chorus."""

If you thought last weekend was an outstanding time to be a football bettor – and it was – wait till you get a load of this weekend.

Not only are Week 2 college football odds on the board, including massive clashes featuring Texas-Alabama and Nebraska vs. Colorado, but the NFL is also back.

And without question, no matter how good college football is, the NFL drives America's sports betting bus.

Let's kick off this week's NFL and college football betting nuggets with the opening game of the NFL season.

Chief Concern

Tuesday brought to light a concerning matter for potential Kansas City Chiefs backers. Star tight end Travis Kelce has a hyperextended knee and is questionable for the big Thursday Night Football opener against the visiting Detroit Lions.

Prior to that news, most sportsbooks had the defending Super Bowl champion Chiefs as favorites of 6.5/7 points. Now, the line is down to -4.5.

""Everyone has an eye peeled for news on the Kelce injury. The current line seems like it's more likely he will play than not,"" said Chris Fargis, senior director of trading risk for Fanatics Sportsbook.

As of Wednesday night, Chiefs bettors seem unfazed by the news, particularly on the moneyline, currently Chiefs -225/Lions +185.

""Customers are piling into Chiefs moneyline bets. We're seeing about six times the Chiefs bets vs. the Lions on the moneyline,"" Fargis said. ""Tons of parlays for the weekend are leading off with Chiefs moneyline on Thursday. The book needs the Lions here, for sure.""

With that moneyline play – be it on straight bets or parlays – the Lions simply covering the 4.5-point spread likely isn't enough for oddsmakers. Fanatics and many others will be rooting for an outright Detroit upset.

Travis Kelce believed to have avoided long-term knee injury Dianna Russini joins Colin Cowherd on the Herd to discuss the latest news on Travis Kelce’s hyperextended knee injury.

The Sharp Side

Circa Sports actually got as low as Chiefs -4 in the wake of the Kelce news. That was more than enough for professional bettor Randy McKay to get involved on the home favorite.

""I just bet Chiefs -4,"" McKay said Wednesday. ""I believe this is too much of an overreaction, with Kelce and defensive lineman Chris Jones already factored in.""

Jones is in a protracted contract holdout. He said Wednesday he could play Thursday if a deal gets done, but that seems unlikely. And again, McKay feels Chiefs -4 is worth it, even if Kelce and Jones don't play.

""I'm still not sold on whether the Dan Campbell regime can win a game in a big environment,"" he said.

Other NFL plays for McKay:

– ""I bet Pittsburgh +3, and that line dropped with all the 49ers' questions, with Nick Bosa and the health of QB Brock Purdy,"" he said of a spread now at 49ers -2.5. ""I like Under 41 as well because both offensive lines are middle-of-the-pack, going against two very good defenses. I could see a slobber-knocker here.""

Purdy is coming back from elbow surgery, and Bosa just ended a holdout Wednesday by signing a five-year, $170 million extension.

– McKay said he also got on the Patriots +4.5 and +4 against the Eagles. ""Philly not only lost the Super Bowl but lost both coordinators,"" McKay said of offensive coordinator Shane Steichen and defensive coordinator Jonathan Gannon, now head coaches of the Colts and Cardinals, respectively. ""I could see Philly starting off slow this year.""

Back To School

Jumping to the college ranks, No. 11 Texas travels to Tuscaloosa to take on No. 3 Alabama in a monster matchup. BetMGM opened this game early in the summer, so it's had a couple of months to percolate.

""It's been dancing around ‘Bama -7 and -7.5 since opening,"" BetMGM senior trader Cameron Drucker said, noting the Tide are -7 Wednesday night. ""Not a ton of sharp action on this one quite yet. It seems like the public is all over the Crimson Tide.

""It's looking like huge liability for us on ‘Bama. We will be rooting for Texas come Saturday.""

In another notable college tilt, No. 13 Oregon travels to Texas Tech. The Red Raiders are coming off a stunning 35-33 double-overtime loss at Wyoming, where they were 14-point favorites. But sharp college football bettor Paul Stone – based in Texas – senses a rebound for Texas Tech, a 6.5-point home underdog to the Ducks.

""The South Plains can be tricky for out-of-town guests. Jones AT&T Stadium is an extremely underrated environment,"" Stone said, while noting part of Saturday's environment could be temperatures in the upper 90s. Stone pointed out that Texas Tech had two big home victories last season: 37-34 over Texas in double OT and 51-48 over Oklahoma in overtime. It was the first time in school history that the Red Raiders beat Texas and Oklahoma in the same season.

""Texas Tech has its back against the wall after last week's misstep. I expect the Red Raiders to fire their best shot and defeat the Ducks outright,"" Stone said.

That has Stone comfortable betting Tech +6.5 for Saturday's 7 p.m. ET kickoff on FOX and the FOX Sports App.

NFL Rocks on FOX

The Green Bay Packers visit the Chicago Bears in FOX's Game of the Week at 4:25 p.m. ET Sunday. With QB Aaron Rodgers no longer under center for the Packers, the Bears are a rare favorite in this NFC North rivalry.

Chicago opened -2.5 back in May and even briefly touched -3 at some books. However, the Bears are down to -1.5 at Fanatics Sportsbook, which is seeing two-way action.

""Very even betting across these two sides. Customers are not showing a preference early in the week,"" Fargis said, before moving on to a player prop that's definitely creating liability. ""Justin Fields to score a touchdown is by far the most popular prop, currently +140. I would say the public is buying into him.""

Fargis also pointed out two more matchups in the NFL Week 1 odds market:

– Dallas Cowboys vs. New York Giants: ""Sixty percent of the moneyline handle is on the Cowboys on the road on Sunday night. Spread and total betting has been balanced so far. I wouldn't be surprised to see this one stay pretty balanced, with customers seeing good reasons to bet both teams in Week 1 prime time."" The Cowboys are -3.5 (even) on the spread and -180 (bet $10 to win $15.56 total) on the moneyline. The Over/Under total is at 46.5 points for Sunday Night Football.

– Buffalo Bills vs. New York Jets: ""From just a count of bets, there's no preference on this one yet from customers. However, more money is coming in on the underdog Jets, on both the spread and moneyline."" Aaron Rodgers & Co. are 2.5-point home underdogs and are +120 on the moneyline. The total is at 46. ""Customers are loving the Over [on] the total on this one, with three times more bets on Over than Under. They're hoping for a high-scoring affair on Monday night.""

I Like Big Bets and I Cannot Lie

OK, let's wrap up this piece with notable big bets. Here are a couple from Caesars Sports:

– $139,000 on Chiefs moneyline -278 vs. Lions. To profit $50,000, for a total payout of $189,000.

– $10,000 on Ravens +1200 to win the AFC. To profit $120,000, for a total payout of $130,000.

Meanwhile, BetMGM took a $10,000 bet on Detroit +2200 to win the Super Bowl. That would profit $220,000, for a total payout of $230,000.

Then there's this gem at BetMGM, wagering a little to make a lot on two big long shots: $100 on Arizona to beat the Houston Texas in the Super Bowl, at odds of 10,000/1 (+1000000). To win $1 million.

As for me, with the NFL season kicking off, I'll have the usual bet on my Denver Broncos to win the Super Bowl. I can get Denver +6000 (60/1) at The SuperBook. It's unlikely to happen, but if it does, that's a lot of #ChilisMoney.

Enjoy the big confluence of NFL and college football betting this weekend.

Warning: This post contains descriptions of sexual violence.



Soon after That ‘70s Show star Danny Masterson was sentenced to 30 years to life in prison for rape charges, Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis’ pre-sentencing letters were leaked to the internet. In response, the internet has been seething with rage over the two, and even one of Masterson’s accusers, Chrissie Carnell Bixler, is speaking out about it.

More from SheKnows



She posted a lengthy response to her Instagram story in light of the letters hitting the internet. She shared her response, in a screenshot obtained by HollywoodLife, by speaking to both Kutcher and Kunis.



Bixler started her response by saying, “Dear Ashton, I know the secrets your ‘role model’ keeps for you. Ones that would end you. Did you forget I was there? You were on speaker phone that night you called Danny on February 21, 2001. I hear everything. I heard the plan. In my opinion, you’re just as sick as your ‘mentor.'”

Many Twitter users were quick to speculate the importance of the date Feb 21, 2001. This has also led many to resurfaced videos of Kutcher’s problematic behavior, specifically his comments about teenage girls.



Bixler also wrote to Kunis, saying, “Dear Mila, I pray you begin to process what you experienced as a child on that set. Your old interviews are very telling. ( I encourage everyone to wash them and decide for yourself what you hear and see. Do so before they get scrubbed from the internet.) I also know what happened in Toronto and after. Question, if that’s what you view as a normal relationship with a ‘big brother figure’ I feel very sad for you, and I hope you consider getting into therapy. You almost forget I was there The whole time those first five years of That ’70s Show. I remember everything.”

Many are speculating what happened in Toronto, as Bixler referred to, but many have also resurfaced these videos she discussed, and have been quite horrified.



The same day, Kutcher and Kunis shared an apology video on Kutcher’s Instagram, which was met with great criticism from thousands of people.



Bixler was Jane Doe 3 in the trial against Masterson, who bravely spoke up with multiple other women.

Back in 2017, five women came forward with sexual assault allegations against Masterson, and singer Cedric Bixler-Zavala alleged soon after that Masterson sexually assaulted his wife. Two years later, the women and Bixler-Zavala alleged Scientologists were harassing them after they came forward with these allegations, per People.



Fast forward to 2020, Masterson was later charged with raping a 23-year-old woman in 2001, a 28-year-old woman in 2003, and another 23-year-old woman in 2003. He was later sentenced to 30 years to life in prison.

301,2023/09/10,'mel tucker',https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2023/09/10/michigan-state-football-coach-sexual-harassment-claim/70679703007/,"UPDATE: This story has been updated with news that within hours of publication of USA TODAY's investigation, MSU suspended Coach Mel Tucker without pay.

Two years ago, one of the nation’s star college football coaches and a prominent rape survivor teamed up to fight the culture of sexual violence in sports.

Their partnership should have been a force for good. Instead, it has devolved into scandal, with the activist accusing the coach of the same misconduct that both of them preached against.

The accused is Mel Tucker, the head football coach at Michigan State University and one of the highest paid coaches in all of sports. Accusing him is Brenda Tracy, a rape survivor who has made educating athletes about sexual violence her life’s work.

Over eight months, they developed a professional relationship centered on her advocacy work. Tucker invited Tracy to campus three times – twice to speak to his players and staff and once to be recognized as an honorary captain at the team's spring football game.

But their relationship was upended during a phone call on April 28, 2022, Tracy says in a complaint she filed with the university’s Title IX office in December that remains under investigation.

According to her complaint, Tracy sat frozen for several minutes while Tucker made sexual comments about her and masturbated. His violation, she said, reopened 25-year-old wounds from her rape by four men – two Oregon State University football players, a junior college player and a high school recruit.

“The idea that someone could know me and say they understand my trauma but then re-inflict that trauma on me is so disgusting to me, it’s hard for me to even wrap my mind around it,” she told USA TODAY. “It’s like he sought me out just to betray me.”

In his statements to the Title IX investigator, Tucker acknowledged masturbating on the call but said Tracy grossly mischaracterized the episode. According to him, they had consensual “phone sex.”

“Ms. Tracy’s distortion of our mutually consensual and intimate relationship into allegations of sexual exploitation has really affected me,” Tucker wrote in a March 22 letter to the investigator. “I am not proud of my judgment and I am having difficulty forgiving myself for getting into this situation, but I did not engage in misconduct by any definition.”

Michigan State hired an outside Title IX attorney to investigate the complaint. She finished her investigation in July. A formal hearing to determine whether Tucker violated the school’s policy banning sexual harassment and exploitation is scheduled for Oct. 5 and 6, during the Spartans’ bye week.

The stakes are high for everyone.

Tracy says Tucker is following through on a threat to ruin her career and reputation by painting her as a woman who mixes professional and personal relationships and files false reports. She fears he will undo her legacy.

Tucker, who signed one of the most lucrative contracts in college sports history two years ago, could lose out on the roughly $80 million he is owed if Michigan State fires him for cause, which would be a stunning fall from the elite ranks of college coaches.

Reached by USA TODAY on his cellphone Saturday night, Tucker hung up after a reporter mentioned the case.

Hours after USA TODAY published its investigation, the university suspended Tucker without pay, pending a resolution of the Title IX case.

“This step, suspending Mel Tucker without pay, is … necessary and appropriate for today's circumstances,” Interim President Teresa Woodruff said at a Sunday evening press conference. “These actions are not taken lightly.”

USA TODAY typically does not identify people who allege sexual harassment. Tracy agreed to be identified and shared more than 1,200 pages of case documents.

Title IX, the federal law banning sex discrimination in education, requires schools to investigate allegations of sexual harassment that took place in the context of a school program or activity. Such claims are inherently difficult to adjudicate because of many of the factors at issue in this case: a lack of eyewitnesses and recordings, the passage of time and the thorniness of litigating consent.

Adding to the uncertainty, the institution tasked with sorting out the facts is perhaps best known for missing repeated opportunities to stop one of the most prolific sexual abusers in American history.

For nearly two decades, Michigan State leaders failed to act on complaints against Larry Nassar, the disgraced former U.S.A. Gymnastics and campus physician accused of sexually assaulting more than 300 female athletes under the guise of medical treatments. He has been sentenced to a minimum of 100 years in prison.

Amid its efforts to rebuild trust among students, employees, alumni and the East Lansing community, Michigan State's leaders must now decide whether the face of its prestigious football program is guilty of sexually harassing one of the country’s most influential advocates against gender-based violence.

For some, how the university navigates the crisis will send a clear message about its commitment to progress.

“This goes beyond coach Tucker and Brenda Tracy,” said Jennifer Gomez, a Boston University professor who researches the effects of interpersonal trauma and violence. “What happens here has the potential to be very healing or very harmful for lots and lots and lots of other people.”

The meeting: Spartans coach, rape survivor forge professional bond through shared mission

Tracy and Tucker met in August 2021 during her first visit to Michigan State, after a mutual acquaintance introduced them.

Standing before a packed auditorium in the Spartans’ football operations building, Tracy told a gut-wrenching story of turning her pain into purpose two decades after filing a police report saying she had been gang-raped as a 24-year-old mother of two.

At the end, she challenged the “good men” in the room to use their privilege and influence to educate themselves and call out bad behavior.

By then she had delivered versions of the speech more than 100 times to at least 40,000 athletes and coaches. Michigan State paid her a $10,000 speaking fee.

Tucker was in his second season as head coach. A former University of Wisconsin-Madison defensive back, he had spent two decades coaching defenses for 10 college and NFL teams before landing the top job at the University of Colorado in late 2018. Michigan State lured him away a year later by doubling his salary.

Mel Tucker's career at Michigan State: A timeline

Tucker and Tracy “hit it off” immediately, they would both later tell the Title IX investigator. They bonded over their love of Jordan sneakers, shelves of which lined Tucker’s office walls.

Tucker had been moved by her speech, and she had been a big hit with players, he told the investigator. They discussed her coming back to campus in the future.

Tracy left East Lansing feeling she had found a champion in Tucker, she told the investigator. He seemed engaged with her cause, leading his players in signing her pledge to, among other things, obtain “ongoing, affirmative consent” before engaging in sexual acts with another person.

Over the next year, their assistants planned two more visits to Michigan State for Tracy, emails, text messages, and itineraries show: the April 2022 spring game where Tracy and her nonprofit, Set The Expectation, would be honored on the jumbotron and a training that July with coaches and players.

During that time, the two also talked on the phone at least 27 times, Tracy’s phone bills show – an average of once every two weeks for a half hour. They often spoke at night to accommodate their work schedules, they said. They chatted about their jobs and eventually more personal matters, such as their families, mental health and daily lives.

They spoke most frequently in fall 2021, while Tucker was leading Michigan State to a 11-2 record – its best season in six years – and negotiating one of the richest coaching contracts of all time.

In November, Michigan State signed him to an unprecedented 10-year, $95 million deal that came fully guaranteed, even if it fired him for poor performance. The only way he could lose out on the money, the contract said, was if he materially breached it, was convicted of a crime or engaged in “conduct which, in the University’s reasonable judgment, would tend to bring public disrespect, contempt or ridicule on the University.”

It was around then that Tucker, who had been married for more than two decades, started becoming interested in Tracy romantically, they both told the investigator.

Whether Tracy reciprocated is where their accounts diverge.

The disputed call: 'You're touching yourself?'

Tucker told the investigator that he and Tracy developed a romantic connection and talked openly about it.

They frequently made flirtatious comments about each other’s looks and bodies, Tucker said. Tracy told him she wanted a “sugar daddy” who would pay her a monthly amount to be his girlfriend, he said, and that she would be “all over” him if he wasn’t married.

Tucker said they had acknowledged their mutual desire for a romance but agreed it would be “too messy” because of his marriage and the physical distance between them.

By contrast, Tracy told the investigator that Tucker’s romantic interest in her was entirely one-sided. She said she came to feel he was less interested in her cause than in her.

Tucker messaged her photos of herself that he had found on her Instagram page, making comments such as, “This is the one,” or complimenting her eyes, Tracy said. Tucker also sent her two gifts – a pair of Jordans and $200 in cash through Venmo – and donated $2,500 to her nonprofit.

Once, Tucker called Tracy via FaceTime. He was in bed, shirtless. He talked about his unhappy marriage, describing himself as “more or less single.” Then, during a Nov. 9, 2021, call, she said he asked her, “If I wasn’t a football coach and if I wasn’t married, would you date me?”

Tracy said she responded that she would not because they worked together – one of several times she recalled trying to set boundaries. She said she made clear to Tucker on a Dec. 1 call that they would only be friends, and he seemed to agree.

Then, after the spring game, Tucker called her four times, phone records show. Tracy said he repeatedly asked her to meet him alone, without her assistant, and even suggested slipping into her hotel through a back door so no one would see him. She said no.

Twelve days later came the call.

Tracy was in her home office in Oregon. Tucker, who was in a hotel in Florida, called her at 12:39 a.m. EST, phone records show. The call lasted 36 minutes.

According to Tucker, he became aroused when Tracy made a comment about needing to hit the gym more to look better without clothes on. They then discussed how having phone sex could complicate their relationship, he said, but Tracy suggested once would be harmless and he agreed.

“Unequivocally, there’s no doubt about it,” Tucker told the investigator, case documents show. “She was the one who said we’ll do it.”

Tracy denies all of that. The call started off normal, she said. But when she sent Tucker a photo of them together from the spring game, she said he responded by commenting on her buttocks and calling himself an “ass man.”

She remembered Tucker’s voice getting deeper and weirder as he continued talking about her buttocks. She asked him what he was doing, and he said he had a “hard dick” and was touching himself.

“You’re touching yourself?” Tracy asked, according to the investigation report. Tucker responded, “Yes.”

Tracy said she thought to herself, ""Oh my god, this is happening, and I can’t stop it."" In the moment, she said, it didn’t occur to her to hang up. Eventually she said something along the lines of, “If you do this, I don’t ever want to hear about it, we are only friends, that’s it.”

When he finished, Tracy said, Tucker told her, “Thank you, good night, sweetheart.” She responded, “Yeah,” and he hung up.

Then she sat at her desk for a while, staring at her phone and crying.

The aftermath: Perceived threat prompts Tracy to file sexual harassment complaint

Three months passed between the call and the next time Tracy and Tucker spoke.

At first, Tracy tried to pretend to herself that nothing had happened. Her partnership with the school was paramount and she focused on that.

Tucker, however, was not responding to her text messages. And he abruptly canceled her in-person training, planned for July 25, three days before it was supposed to take place. A team staffer told her they had double-booked, but Tracy believed she knew the real reason.

When Tracy finally got Tucker on the phone about a week later, he was angry, she said, accusing her and her assistant of gossiping about his marital problems.

Tracy recalled that Tucker made comments such as, “I can’t trust you,” “If you say anything about this, I’ll hear about it,” and “I’ll be fine, it’s you that I am worried about.” She viewed it as a threat to destroy her reputation if she spoke out about him.

Tucker at one point told her he had done nothing wrong. According to Tracy, she started to say, “Well, something…” referring to his masturbation, and Tucker interrupted, saying, “But nothing happened.”

Tucker recalled the Aug. 2 phone call much differently. He told the investigator that Tracy apologized to him for discussing his marriage with her assistant, and he accepted. Although they ended the call on good terms and discussed postponing her visit until next year, Tucker said he had lost trust in Tracy.

The training was never rescheduled, and they never spoke again.

Tracy initially stayed quiet about Tucker for the sake of her career, she said. Ultimately, she decided that if she let it slide, she wouldn’t be the person she claimed to be – the one who encourages people to speak up about sexual misconduct and hold others accountable.

She filed her complaint in December – eight months after the call. In dry and bureaucratic language, the record of that complaint begins: “The specific allegations of prohibited conduct against Respondent are as follows …” A notification was delivered to Tucker the following day.

Tucker was “absolutely shocked,” he would tell the university’s investigator. In subsequent correspondence, he and his attorney suggested Tracy’s motive: She held a vendetta against Spartans athletics because of its history of sexual misconduct scandals and falsely accused him for financial gain.

“To say that I have learned from this situation is an understatement,” Tucker wrote in a letter to the investigator on March 22. “I will never again allow myself to be duped by kindness.”

The investigation: Tucker moves to halt case as investigator gets to work

The university tapped Rebecca Leitman Veidlinger, an Ann Arbor, Michigan-based Title IX attorney, to conduct the investigation.

A former Indiana sex crimes prosecutor who now heads a private practice, she also previously worked in the Title IX offices at Michigan State and the University of Michigan.

Veidlinger started her investigation in January by interviewing Tracy and six people she had identified as witnesses, including three of Tucker’s assistants who had been involved in coordinating and canceling her campus visits.

Tracy’s other three witnesses – her assistant, therapist and attorney – told Veidlinger that a distraught Tracy had disclosed the situation to them in early August, within days of her final phone call with Tucker.

Jacqueline Swanson, Tracy’s attorney who is also her friend, turned over a copy of the notes she took from their conversation on a yellow legal pad.

Ahlan Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant and best friend who had attended the April 2022 spring game, said she had been with Tracy in their hotel after the game when Tucker repeatedly called Tracy asking to meet her alone.

Alvarado said Tracy had told her previously that Tucker “liked” her and it could become a problem. She shared a screenshot of a Dec. 2 text message in which Tracy told her she had just spoken with Tucker, who had agreed they could only be friends.

“I’m glad it didn’t get weird,” Tracy wrote.

Tracy provided phone bills and emails that corroborated her timeline of events and showed Tucker had been calling her from his personal cellphone.

Although Veidlinger had interviewed all six of Tracy’s witnesses before the end of January, Tucker didn’t agree to be interviewed until late March. In the intervening weeks, he and his attorney, Jennifer Belveal, tried to stop the investigation.

Tracy said Belveal twice contacted her attorney, Karen Truszkowski, proposing a settlement agreement. Tracy said no.

Tucker and Belveal also urged Michigan State to drop Tracy’s complaint. In January, they sent a 12-page letter to the school arguing it lacked jurisdiction to investigate Tucker's “purely personal” relationship with Tracy.

They later commissioned Brett Sokolow, board chairman and co-founder of the Association of Title IX Administrators, to write an “expert witness” report asserting that policing employees’ “off duty” activities would set a dangerous legal precedent.

“Can an employee never have phone sex?” Sokolow wrote. “How far does MSU intend to go in policing the private conduct of its employees, and how does it expect its 20,000+ employees to react when they find out that they no longer have private lives outside the reach of their employer?”

Michigan State was not persuaded. The alleged conduct would be covered by school policy, it concluded, because it took place in the context of Tracy’s work as a vendor for the school and affected their ongoing business relationship.

The case would go forward.

The findings: Records refute Tucker's story; his attorney alleges bias

Tucker sat down for his interview on March 22.

He said he wanted to be transparent and set the record straight. But Veidlinger would note some key inconsistencies.

For instance, Tucker claimed he had made the phone sex call from home in East Lansing – not in a Florida hotel. He had just returned from a trip to Florida, he said, where he had been doing charity work unrelated to his employment with the school.

Veidlinger, however, had obtained documents showing Tucker had, in fact, been in Naples, Florida, the day of the call – attending the Greg Montgomery Foundation Golf Outing on the school’s dime.

An expense report Tucker submitted to Michigan State for his hotel and meal costs showed the trip's purpose was “administrative” and did not involve any personal travel. The costs were paid by the Spartan Fund, the athletic department’s fundraising arm; he had flown to Florida on a donor’s private plane.

Tucker told Veidlinger he had canceled Tracy’s July 25 in-person training because his new mental conditioning coach, Ben Newman, needed to implement a new program. But Veidlinger would obtain records from the school showing Newman had been meeting weekly with the team since early June and did not hold any meetings between July 15 and 28.

During the interview, Tucker also made an explosive new allegation: He said his associate had told him that renowned ESPN investigative reporter Paula Lavigne was investigating the veracity of the gang-rape story at the heart of Tracy’s public persona. The information, Tucker said, made him question how Tracy “goes about her business.”

Veidlinger did not address this allegation in her report, but Lavigne denied the allegation.

“Neither (Tracy's) organization nor Tracy is or has been the target of any investigative reporting,” Lavigne said in a statement to USA TODAY. “I’m perplexed that Mel Tucker would respond to a complaint of sexual harassment by involving me or ESPN.”

Tucker did not identify any witnesses who could support his version of events, including his associate, whom he said he had promised anonymity. That same associate, Tucker said, told him that Alvarado, Tracy’s assistant, had been gossiping about his marriage – a claim Alvarado denied.

Veidlinger delivered her final 106-page investigation report in July.

Along the way, she had learned that one potentially rich source of evidence was missing: Both Tracy and Tucker had deleted their text messages with each other. Tucker would tell her that he deletes his messages regularly because he receives so many; Tracy said she did so in a panic after their last phone call, feeling she needed to cut all ties with him.

Per Title IX and school policy, Veidlinger did not issue a finding of fault in her final report, but instead summarized the facts and referred the case for a hearing.

At the hearing, planned for October, both sides will have the opportunity to present evidence and make arguments. Another outside Title IX attorney hired by the school will then decide whether the evidence shows that Tucker likely violated school rules.

Among the witnesses who will be missing from Tracy’s witness list is her assistant and best friend, Alvarado. She died in a car accident in June.

Meanwhile, Belveal argued Alvarado’s death “presents yet another reason that this case should be dismissed.”

Letters Belveal sent Veidlinger throughout the case accuse her of bias against Tucker – and men more broadly.

One letter in May contained a list of 170 perceived problems with Veidlinger’s draft report and questions she should have asked Tracy and her witnesses. They included why Tracy had not returned Tucker’s gifts, why she had given him her Venmo username and what opinions she held about Michigan State basketball coach Tom Izzo, former football coach Mark Dantonio and former president John Engler, all of whom had been associated with past sexual misconduct controversies.

A fair process, Belveal wrote, would expose Tracy’s allegations as “nothing more than another agenda-driven attempt … to defame Respondent and the University.”

“We request that the investigation be reopened,” Belveal wrote, “that each of the questions be asked of the appropriate witnesses, that jurisdiction be reassessed, and that the matter be dismissed.”

Justin K. Aller/Getty Images

Purdy made only eight starts during his 2022 rookie campaign (three of which came in the playoffs), but he showed enough to San Francisco to be named its starting quarterback moving forward. And on Sunday, the 2022 seventh-round draft pick again showed by.

On a big day for the 49ers' offense, Purdy completed 19 of his 29 pass attempts for 220 yards and two touchdowns (each of which went to Aiyuk). The 23-year-old QB also looked healthy after tearing the UCL in his right elbow during the NFC Championship Game last season.

""Purdy shut some haters up [Sunday],"" San Francisco defensive end Nick Bosa said, per ESPN's Nick Wagoner. ""I think whenever a guy comes back from an injury, people kind of don't expect him to make another leap in the second year, I'm just happy for him. He's exactly who we thought he was."""

The Baltimore Ravens have been dealt a serious blow to the ground game already.

Running back J.K. Dobbins suffered a torn Achilles that will end his season, head coach John Harbaugh confirmed after the team's Week 1 matchup against the Houston Texans:

Ian Rapoport of NFL Network initially reported that Dobbins was feared to have suffered a torn Achilles after he left the game:

The Ravens initially listed Dobbins as questionable to return with an ankle injury:

Dobbins had eight carries for 22 yards and a touchdown before leaving the game.

Dobbins limped off of the field with help from some Ravens staff and was replaced by Justice Hill.

Dobbins was a second-round pick in 2020 and had a promising rookie season, rushing for 805 yards and nine touchdowns. His 2021 season ended in the preseason as a result of a torn ACL and he was limited to just eight games in 2022. He had 520 yards and two touchdowns in that half season, so he still showed that he had some explosion post injury.

An Achilles tear is devastating to Dobbins and the Ravens given the aforementioned injury history and would further deplete the team's depth at tailback. Hill and Gus Edwards are the only other backs on the Ravens depth chart who are active as Keaton Mitchell is currently on IR."

The Silver and Black nabbed their first victory of the season in a game defined by long, methodical drives from both teams. The Raiders opened up the game with a 5:32 minute drive, ending in a touchdown strike from Jimmy Garoppolo to Jakobi Meyersï»¿. The Broncos responding with a 8:44 drive of their own, resulting in a touchdown pass from Russell Wilson to Lil'Jordan Humphrey.

This is the first Raiders-Broncos matchup in which both teams scored a touchdown on their opening drive since December 29, 2013.

The game was a back-and-forth affair, with both teams trying to capitalize off the other's mistakes. Both teams racked up 10 penalties each. The Broncos special teams struggled with a missed extra point and missed field goal by Will Lutz.

After trailing for the majority of the second half, Garoppolo found Meyers once again for six-yard touchdown to put the Raiders up 17-16 with 6:34 remaining in the game."

308,2023/09/11, 'kevin porter jr',https://www.espn.com/nba/story/_/id/38379204/rockets-kevin-porter-jr-charged-assault-strangulation,"Open Extended Reactions

Houston Rockets guard Kevin Porter Jr. was arrested and charged with assault and strangulation after an incident at a New York hotel Monday morning, a New York City police spokesperson said.

Police responded to a 911 call reporting an assault at 6:45 a.m. and arrested Porter, 23, after an investigation. Both charges are felonies.

The incident involved Porter's girlfriend, a former WNBA player, sources told ABC News.

""Upon arrival officers were informed that a 26-year-old female sustained a laceration to the right side of her face and was complaining about pain to her neck,"" the spokesperson said. ""A preliminary investigation on scene determined that a known individual struck her multiple times upon her body and placed his hands around the neck.""

The woman was transported to the hospital for evaluation, the police spokesperson said.

""We are in the process of gathering information surrounding the matter involving Kevin Porter Jr.,"" the Rockets said in a statement. ""We have no further comment at this time.""

The NBA also acknowledged Porter's arrest, saying in a statement through spokesman Mike Bass: ""The league office is in contact with the Houston Rockets and in the process of gathering more information.""

While the NBA is conducting its own investigation, the Rockets aren't allowed to administer any immediate punishment on Porter, including a suspension.

Under the terms of the league's domestic violence policy, commissioner Adam Silver has the power to place Porter on administrative leave with pay for ""a reasonable period of time."" Based on the findings of the case, the commissioner can fine, suspend, dismiss or disqualify from any further association with the league and its teams a player who violates the domestic violence policy.

Porter signed a four-year contract extension worth as much as $82.5 million last season. However, it is only partially guaranteed due to Porter's history of off-court issues. If the Rockers were to eventually waive Porter based on the results of this investigation or a criminal conviction, the franchise would be responsible for only the $16.9 million of guaranteed money left on his contract.

Porter was the No. 30 pick in the 2019 draft after spending one season at USC, where he was suspended because of conduct issues. He played his rookie season for the Cleveland Cavaliers but did not join the team the next season due to personal reasons. He was traded to the Rockets for a top-55-protected second-round pick in January 2021 in the wake of a shouting match with Cleveland team officials.

The impacts of the horrific acts of September 11, 2001, were vast and far-reaching - thousands of lives were lost and families, friends, and our nation were left grieving.

In the days and years since, we have also seen hope – from the heroic acts of bravery from first responders and our armed forces to an ongoing commitment from the public and private sectors to protect our country from a similar tragedy.

The events of September 11 forced our nation to reassess how we look at safety and security. From that tragedy, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) arose. In the years since, DHS has led the charge in assessing threats and developing and implementing regulations which aim to protect the country from future attacks.

Chemical manufacturing facilities, like other critical infrastructure such as the electrical sector, were identified early-on as potential high-risk targets. So, while DHS began the important work of establishing what is now known as the Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standard (CFATS), the American Chemistry Council (ACC) and our members immediately took action of our own.

In 2002, 5 years before CFATS was officially launched, ACC’s Board of Directors approved the adoption of the Responsible Care Security Code – a commitment by ACC members and Responsible Care partners to enhance the security of our facilities and our communities. The Code outlines 10 Management Practices to help companies continually improve security by identifying, assessing and addressing vulnerabilities, enhancing training and response capabilities, and engaging with customers, suppliers, service providers and government agencies.

The Security Code builds on the foundation of environmental health, safety and security established under Responsible Care and is recognized by local, state and federal governments as a model security program for chemical facilities and other U.S. industries. In fact, the DHS SAFETY Act recognizes the Security Code as a Qualified Anti-Terrorism Technology.

In 2007, after years of dedicated work by DHS and industry stakeholders, ACC and our members pushed for the adoption of CFATS and the resources and support of the U.S. government to help protect our workers and our communities.

We recognize it takes a commitment from all stakeholders, public and private, to keep our country safe from those who would threaten it. That’s why ACC and our members were disappointed that Congress, despite strong bipartisan support for the program, failed to reauthorize CFATS before a July deadline. The program’s expiration has suspended the valuable resources and tools that the program provided our industry.

This week, as we reflect on the tragedy of September 11th, we urge Congress to act swiftly to remedy this failure, reinstate CFATS, and support the chemical industry’s continued efforts to protect our workers, our communities, and our nation."

August's core inflation print in the consumer price index increased 0.3% and 4.3% respectively, against estimates for 0.2% and 4.3%. Federal Reserve officials focus more on the core number as it provides a better indication of where inflation is heading over the long term.

Meanwhile, the headline numbers rose 0.6% last month, and was up 3.7% from a year ago. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones were looking for respective increases of 0.6% and 3.6%.

""This report interrupts the run of good news [and] makes it more difficult to talk a happy game about inflation,"" said Vincent Reinhart, chief economist at Dreyfus and Mellon. ""It doesn't matter for the upcoming FOMC meeting's results. They're not going to act. They have not signaled action. Market participants do not expect action. And that's because they've shifted down the pace of tightening.""

""If they act, it will be in November,"" Reinhart added.

Wall Street has mostly priced in a pause in rate hikes at the Fed's meeting next week. Fed funds futures pricing data as of Wednesday afternoon indicate a 97% probability of rates remaining the same, according to the CME FedWatch Tool.

One of Kanye West’s exes seems to approve of his highly publicized relationship with his “wife,” Bianca Censori.

Chaney Jones, whom West dated briefly last year, just “liked” an Instagram post containing new photos of the head-turning couple in Germany.

Photographers snapped West and Censori out in Berlin Thursday afternoon, where they waited in line at a kebab joint.

The rapper-turned-fashion designer, 46, wore his go-to all-black getup featuring a layered hoodie that covered his face, pants and socks. As usual, he chose to ditch his shoes.

West removed his facial covering while he and Censori enjoyed their lunches on a nearby park bench.

The Yeezy architect, for her part, also kept things predictable in a sheer nude catsuit.

The bizarre ensemble appeared to be comprised of a single pair of tights hoisted high above her chest.

Though Censori, 28, made sure to sport a pair of beige boy shorts underneath her completely see-through outfit, she decided to skip a bra and free both nipples.

The Australian beauty completed her look with clear pointy-toed heels, a black side-slung backpack and an unusually big smile.

She and her Grammy-winning “husband” committed their love to each other in a non-legally binding wedding ceremony in January — just two months after his divorce from his first wife, Kim Kardashian, was finalized.

But Censori isn’t the first woman to steal West’s heart following his split from the reality star, 42, who filed to end their six-year marriage in February 2021.

In fact, he was linked to supermodel Irina Shayk that summer before hooking up with another model, Venetria, that fall.

West moved on with actress-turned-influencer Julia Fox, whom he dated from January to February 2022 amid a slew of social media tirades aimed at Kardashian’s then-boyfriend, Pete Davidson.

After their fling fizzled, the musician immediately began seeing Jones, who — like Censori — has been branded a Kardashian look-alike.

Storylines we're following in the 2023 NFL season

Important dates to remember:

The 2023 NFL regular season runs today through Jan. 7, 2024.

Playoffs are scheduled for January 13 through Jan. 28, 2004.

Super Bowl LVIII is scheduled for Feb. 11, 2024 in Las Vegas

Damar Hamlin's return: When Buffalo Bills safety Damar Hamlin went into cardiac arrest during the team's January 2 Monday Night Football game against the Cincinnati Bengals, the world looked on in shock as medics worked on the field to revive him. Hamlin was resuscitated three times on the field before he was able to be transported to a local hospital. Hamlin spent a week in the hospital before his release. In April, the Bills standout known for his offseason charity work, was cleared to play -- an ill-timed hit to the heart blamed for his collapse on the field. Hamlin participated in the Bills offseason OTAs and played in three preseason games, but likely won't suit up for tonight's game against the Jets as Hamlin was signed this season as a backup safety and special teams player.

Can Dak Prescott improve enough this season? Though Cowboys QB Dak Prescott led the league in interceptions in 2022, Dak squashed the Giants in a humbling 40-0 victory. Dallas' defense actually held the Giants at bay, but Dak hopes to deliver on his promise that the Cowboys will show major improvements this season. Dak threw for 143 yards in Week 1, but will likely have to work harder to get past Aaron Rodgers in Week 2.

Lamar Jackson/OBJ in Baltimore: Sure, the Baltimore Ravens scored an easy 25-9 victory over the Houston Texans Sunday, but the Texans QB C.J. Stroud was making his NFL career debut. Despite the victory, Lamar looked like he hadn't completely wiped away the offseason cobwebs, turning the ball over twice. He did manage two touchdowns in the third quarter, a hopeful sign of things to come for Ravens fans. The only thing that could upstage Lamar's rushing touchdowns and athleticism is Odell Beckham Jr., who made his Ravens debut Sunday much to the delight of fans of the famed wide receiver.

Aaron Rodgers in a new shade of green: Four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers takes over from former Tampa Bay Buccaneers QB Tom Brady as the oldest active player in the league. All eyes will be on the 39-year-old Hard Knocks star, who traded in his Green Bay Packers uniform for a Jets green uniform after 18 seasons in Green Bay.

A-Rod is already making his mark in New York mentoring younger players like Jets CB Sauce Gardner, whom Rodgers calls a ""future Hall of Famer."" The Jets haven't won the Super Bowl since 1969 and haven't made the playoffs since 2010. Rodgers made the playoffs a total of nine times with the Packers. The Jets have $112 million invested in Rodgers adding a tenth trip to the postseason to his resume.

Can the Rams run it back: The LA Rams looked great in their Week 1 game against the Seahawks, even without superstar wide receiver Cooper Kupp, who's on the injured list with a nagging hamstring injury. Coach McVay will want Kupp back on the field asap, especially since the Rams face Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers in Week 2. Purdy (again) silenced cynics in the Niners 30-7 victory Sunday over the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Open Extended Reactions

FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- After losing quarterback Aaron Rodgers to a season-ending Achilles tear, confirmed Tuesday by an MRI, New York Jets coach Robert Saleh gave Zach Wilson a strong endorsement as the new starter and scoffed at those who believe their playoff hopes are ruined.

""I don't know why people are trying to put an obituary under our team name,"" Saleh told reporters on a Zoom call.

Rodgers, injured on the Jets' fourth snap of the season, was placed on injured reserve and will have surgery to repair his Achilles. Saleh declined to reveal a timetable but indicated their hope is that the four-time MVP -- the centerpiece to their blockbuster offseason -- will stay with the team during his rehab.

The devastating injury sparked intense speculation about possible replacements. The Jets are expected to add a veteran, but Saleh emphasized that Wilson is the new QB1 and that no acquisition would be brought in to compete with the former first-round pick.

""I do want to make it very clear: Zach's our quarterback,"" Saleh said. ""We've got a lot of faith in Zach.

""This is Zach's team, and we're rolling with Zach,"" he added.

Wilson, who struggled last season and was demoted twice, will make his 23rd career start Sunday at the Dallas Cowboys (1-0). Journeyman Tim Boyle will be brought up from the practice squad to be the primary backup for the game.

The Jets' grand plan was to have Wilson, 24, learn under Rodgers for a couple of years before returning him to the starting job, but everything changed 4:04 into Monday night's 22-16 overtime victory over the Buffalo Bills.

Trying to spin away from defensive end Leonard Floyd, Rodgers' left leg was planted in the turf and his Achilles ruptured. A slow-motion replay showed his left calf -- the same calf he strained in organized team activities -- reverberating as he went down for the sack.

The offensive linemen tried to help him up, but Rodgers told them, ""I'm not getting up,"" according to guard Alijah Vera-Tucker.

It was a crushing blow to the Jets, who traded for Rodgers and built their season around him. Because of his age (39) and the severity of the injury, his future is now a major question.

Before Monday night, the former Green Bay Packers star said on numerous occasions that he wanted to play a few more years. He is under contract through 2025 and due a total of $75 million in guarantees after taking a voluntary $35 million pay cut in August. He is making $37 million this season, all guaranteed.

Saleh declined to speculate on Rodgers' future.

""As you guys can imagine, he's down,"" Saleh said. ""I'll let him answer those questions. I didn't get into the future of what he's expecting or what he's thinking. I think that's a conversation, tactfully, left for another day. But he's, as you can imagine, with everything that he's invested in this, he's obviously a little disappointed.""

Rodgers faces several months of intensive rehab, but the Jets want him around.

""We all want him to be connected, and I think he wants to be here,"" Saleh said.

The Jets, who began the season with Super Bowl aspirations, will turn to the quarterback they sent to the bench in the offseason. They billed this as a ""reset"" season for Wilson, who spent the past few months learning at Rodgers' side. The hope was that he would be able to improve his fundamentals while not having the pressure of being the starter.

Wilson sparked a firestorm last season when, after a poor performance against the New England Patriots, he declined to accept any blame for the loss in his postgame news conference. Two days later, he was benched.

He said he is ""a lot more prepared"" after having worked with Rodgers.

""The hardest part is now putting it into a game, and I've got to be able to do that,"" Wilson said Monday night.

After replacing Rodgers during the first possession, Wilson (14-for-21, 140 yards) was uneven. He threw into coverage for a costly interception but also helped rally the team from a 10-point deficit in the fourth quarter with a 3-yard touchdown pass to Garrett Wilson.

Wilson won five of his first six starts last season, although he passed for under 155 yards in three of those victories.

""Everything about him is just so much different than a year ago,"" Saleh said. ""It's happening faster than I think anyone expected, obviously, under the circumstances, but he's somebody that's made a drastic improvement from a year ago.""

Rodgers' injury sparked conversation around the league on the new turf field at MetLife Stadium and the overall safety of turf surfaces. Eagles cornerback Darius Slay, speaking to reporters in Philadelphia, ripped the quality of the field.

""MetLife, everybody knows about that god damn stadium,"" Slay said. ""They need to get real grass. That's trash. That's sad for anybody to go down because we play this dangerous game, man. Everybody thinks we're superheroes, but we're really not.""

Saleh doesn't think the field caused the injury, saying, ""No. If it was a noncontact injury, I think that'd be something to discuss, obviously. But that was kind of a forcible [injury]. I think that was trauma induced. I do know the players prefer grass and there's a lot invested in those young men.""

In the preseason, Rodgers said he prefers to play on grass but said MetLife Stadium is ""one of the best surfaces I've seen that's artificial.""

ESPN's Tim McManus contributed to this report."
314,2023/09/12, 'zach wilson',https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/why-jets-robert-saleh-adamantly-believes-in-zach-wilson-as-qb1-after-aaron-rodgers-season-ending-injury/,"The 2023 New York Jets thought of themselves as Super Bowl contenders after acquiring four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers this offseason. The former Packers legend, combined with a top-five scoring defense, was supposed to be enough to challenge in a tough AFC.

That could still be the case, but they won't be doing so with Rodgers under center after he suffered a season-ending torn Achilles in Monday night's 22-16 overtime win over the Buffalo Bills. The team has since placed Rodgers on injured reserve.

""I feel more for Aaron than anyone,"" head coach Robert Saleh said Tuesday. ""He has invested so much into this organization and this journey he's embarked on and wanting to be a part of what we've got going on here. How much he has invested into not only this organization but his teammates, himself, this fanbase, this city. I have a lot of emotions for him and for us. It's really all about him. I don't look at it as 'woe is me.' I think guys are excited to step up and continue the things we have been building, but a lot of hurt for Aaron.""

Naturally, Gang Green is going to do its due diligence on veteran quarterbacks it could acquire from other teams around the league, but Saleh was demonstratively clear about who the Jets next quarterback is going to be: their second overall pick from the 2021 NFL Draft, Zach Wilson.

""We are going to look through some things, but I do want to make it very clear, Zach's our quarterback. We have a lot of faith in Zach. We're really excited about his opportunity. We're rolling with Zach and excited for him. We're going to look at everything. You're going to look at veterans, you're going to look at young guys. Under no circumstance is this a [quarterback] competition, this is Zach's team. We're rolling with Zach.""

It's fair to question why Saleh and the Jets organization has so much confidence in Wilson given he has the unique distinction of being the only quarterback since the AFL-NFL merger in 1970 to finish last in the NFL in passer rating in consecutive seasons (69.7 in 2021 and 72.8 in 2022). However, his play was better prior to losing two of his top teammates, running back Breece Hall and right guard Alijah Vera-Tucker, to season-ending injuries in Week 7 against the Denver Broncos.

We lost half our offense. ... Zach is a very capable quarterback. He has proven to be a very capable quarterback. We have what we believe is a championship-caliber defense, and we have offensive skill guys we are very confident in. We have an offensive line that is, knock on wood, healthy and that we hope will stay healthy to build continuity. We have all the faith in the world in Zach. The best part of Zach is he is leap years from where he was a year ago.""

A year ago, Jets players were seen gleefully sporting Mike White T-shirts when he was inserted into the starting lineup in place of Wilson. Those feelings were stoked when Wilson failed to take accountability for the offense's performance in a 10-3 loss at the New England Patriots in Week 11 of last season. Now, those sentiments are in the past over in Florham Park, New Jersey.

""From a mental standpoint, he's so much different than this time a year ago,"" Saleh said of Wilson. He is in a great frame of mind. He's loving the game of football. He's loving the process he's going through. He has a lot of confidence. All the little things we saw in college [at BYU] that he was struggling with a year ago... he has fixed a lot of things. We're very excited about him. He would acknowledge he has a lot of things to learn and grow, but we're excited to do that with him. He has been able to rebuild rapport with his teammates. The overall way he has handled himself has been fantastic. ... It is happening faster than anyone expected, obviously under the circumstances. He is someone who has made a drastic improvement from a year ago.""

Saleh went out of his way to clarify how he would describe Wilson's relationship development with his teammates.

""It's more confidence in terms of his ability to enjoy the process and the practice habits, not that they were bad, but teammates want to see guys make plays and have confidence you can do your job to the best of your ability. Over the course of training camp and OTAs, Zach has had a lot of success. He had a really nice preseason. He has built a lot of confidence with his teammates. We still think Zach is fully capable of running the offense. There is going to be nuance that might be different [with him in place of Rodgers].""

While the hope is for Rodgers to be ever present like a coach for Wilson and the rest of his teammates, the Jets understand he may want to take some time away from it all to process his season-ending injury.

""We all want him here,"" Saleh said of Rodgers. ""We all want him to be connected and I think he wants to be here. We will give him time to breathe and digest everything.""

What Saleh and the Jets refuse to digest is the idea that their 2023 season is done for after one game, even with the loss of a future Hall of Fame quarterback.

""I don't know why people are trying to put an obituary on our team name,"" Saleh said. ""Aaron is an unbelievable piece of this whole thing and we love him, but I think there are 52 other guys in the locker room plus the 16 practice squad guys that believe we can do a hell of a lot of things. We have a championship-caliber defense, great skill guys on the offensive side of the ball. Our offensive line is going to continue to gel and get better. We're excited about our group. We have worked hard the last couple of years: players, coaches, scouts, and our GM to build a pretty cool organization. There is still a lot of faith in the locker room for the things we can still accomplish this year. While the outside world can go ahead and write whatever story you want to write, there's still the true story being written in this building.""

When asked what his message to the Jets' wounded fanbase would be Tuesday afternoon, Saleh kept it short and sweet, looking forward to what lies ahead in Week 2.

""We're on to Dallas,"" Saleh said, channeling AFC East rival and New England Patriots head coach Bill Belichick."

Austin isn't the school most people think of when talking about college football in the state of Texas. But the school of just over 11,000 students has had some success in its 100-year program history. The Lumberjacks won the WAC conference title in 2022 on the back of a 5'9 receiver named Xavier Gipson.

Gipson, now a household name after his game-winning punt return touchdown in his first NFL game for the New York Jets, didn't have the easiest path to football stardom. But, like most undrafted players, he made his opportunities count. Here's how Gipson got to the NFL.

The vitals on Xavier Gipson

School: Stephen F. Austin

Position: Wide receiver/Kick Returner/Punt Returner

Height: 5-9

Weight: 189 pounds

Years active: 2019-2022

Xavier Gipson as a high school prospect

Before Stephen F. Austin, Gipson attended Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas, about 165 miles northeast from the Lumberjacks' home stadium in Nagadoches, Texas. Woodrow Wilson isn't exactly a football powerhouse in Texas, but they have had their fair share of talent come through their program. It remains the only public high school in America to produce two Heisman trophy winners. Davey O'Brien and Tim Brown both spent their high school days playing for the Wildcats.

In high school, Gipson mostly played cornerback and ran track. He was rated a three-star cornerback by 247Sports and committed to SMU the summer before his senior season. After a strong final season at Woodrow Wilson where Gipson notched three special teams touchdowns, he decommitted from SMU and quickly flipped his college intentions to Stephen F. Austin.

Xavier Gipson's college stats

Gipson provided an instant impact for Stephen F. Austin in his freshman season. He led the team in every major receiving category, with 52 catches for 934 yards and seven touchdowns in his first collegiate season, while also averaging more than 20 yards per kick return. For his strong season, Gipson was named a freshman All-American by HERO Sports.

Gipson's sophomore season provided more of the same, as he once again led the Lumberjack's receiving group. He hauled in more than half of the team's receiving touchdowns with nine scores on the season. Gipson also logged his first collegiate punt return touchdown with a 42-yard score against Angelo State. In the same game, he hauled in five receptions for 177 yards and two touchdowns.

All FOUR Xavier Gipson catches.

In 2021 Gipson was named an FCS All-American after leading the division with 1,367 receiving yards. Gipson also logged 15 total touchdowns, including a 70-yard punt return score against Mississippi Valley State.

In his final year in Nagadoches, Gipson once again exceeded his lofty expectations, mostly as a returner. He averaged 25 yards per return, and scored twice in this role. Gipson was named WAC offensive player of the year as well as a first-team All-American.

The Democratic candidate in a competitive Virginia House district denounced reports that she and her husband had performed sexual acts on a pornographic livestreaming website, describing the sharing of those videos as “the worst gutter politics.”

The existence of the sexually explicit videos, first reported by The Washington Post on Monday, has injected a highly sensitive issue into one of the most competitive races in this fall’s battle for control of the Virginia General Assembly.

Susanna Gibson, a nurse practitioner, faces Republican David Owen, a retired home builder, in the 57th District, a suburban Richmond seat that is key to Democratic hopes of upending the 50-46 GOP majority in November’s elections. It’s one of seven competitive state House districts, according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project.

Democrats, meanwhile, are defending a 22-18 state Senate majority. The outcome of this year’s legislative races could determine whether Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin can enact conservative policies, including a 15-week abortion ban, amid speculation about his potential late entry into the 2024 GOP presidential race.

Gibson, a 40-year-old mother of two young children, and her husband, a lawyer, reportedly streamed sex acts in exchange for “tips” on a livestreaming pornographic website. Those videos were recorded and then archived on another site. The Post reported it had been alerted to the videos’ existence by a Republican operative. CNN has not independently verified the content of the videos.

The videos were first livestreamed on a website that is not password-protected and on which The Post reported the couple had more than 5,700 followers. Gibson’s attorney, Daniel P. Watkins, said that sharing the videos violated the state’s revenge porn law.

“Capturing and disseminating this content without permission is unlawful recording and it plainly violates Virginia’s revenge porn statute. We are working closely with law enforcement to bring accountability to the wrongdoers,” he told CNN in an email.

“This is an illegal invasion of my privacy designed to humiliate me and my family. It won’t intimidate me and it won’t silence me,” Gibson said in a statement shared with CNN on Tuesday.

“My political opponents and their Republican allies have proven they’re willing to commit a sex crime to attack me and my family because there’s no line they won’t cross to silence women when they speak up,” she said. “They are trying to silence me because they want to silence you, and I won’t let that happen.”

She added: “My opponent and his allies know that the people of this district are on our side on the issues, so they’re stooping to the worst gutter politics. There’s too much at stake in this election and I’ll never stop fighting for our community.”

Owen, Gibson’s Republican opponent, said in a statement that he found out about the existence of the videos on Monday when The Post story was published “like everyone else.”

“I’m sure this is a difficult time for Susanna and her family, and I’m remaining focused on my campaign,” he said.

The Virginia House Democratic Caucus declined to comment, pointing instead to Gibson’s statement."

318,2023/09/13, 'mexico alien',https://abc7.com/mexico-aliens-corpses-ufos/13776957/,"Scientists in Mexico are pulling back the curtain on what they believe are aliens, and they put two corpses on display.

Scientists in Mexico are pulling back the curtain on what some believe are aliens, and the remains of ""non-human"" beings were put on display.

Two small mummified specimens were presented Tuesday at Mexico's first public congressional hearing on Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAPs), also known as UFOs.

Displaying two mummified bodies he claimed to be not from Earth, journalist and UFO researcher Jaime Maussan and other experts proposed that the Mexican Chamber of Deputies recognize UAPs, to guarantee airspace security and to allow it to be studied. The shriveled bodies with shrunken, warped heads left those in the chamber aghast and quickly kicked up a social media fervor.

""It's the queen of all evidence,"" Maussan claimed. ""That is, if the DNA is showing us that they are non-human beings and that there is nothing that looks like this in the world, we should take it as such."" But he warned that he didn't want to refer to them as ""extraterrestrials"" just yet.

The apparently desiccated bodies date back to 2017 and were found deep underground in the sandy Peruvian coastal desert of Nazca. The area is known for gigantic enigmatic figures scraped into the earth and seen only from a birds-eye-view. Most attribute the Nazca Lines to ancient indigenous communities, but the formations have captured the imaginations of many.

SEE ALSO: Las Vegas police respond to home after 911 call claims UFO with aliens crashed in backyard

A family claims they saw an object from out of this world fall out of the sky and land in their backyard. ABC News' Andrew Dymburt has the reaction from responding officers.

Maussan said it was a clear demonstration that the presented bodies were non-human specimens, and that researchers could prove that the DNA of the two mummies did not belong to human beings.

""This is the first time it (extraterrestrial life) is presented in such a form and I think there is a clear demonstration that we are dealing with non-human specimens that are not related to any other species in our world and that any scientific institution can investigate it,"" he said.

X-rays of the ""aliens"" were also shown during the hearing, and experts say one of the bodies had eggs inside.

Congressman Sergio Gutiérrez Luna of the ruling Morena party, made it clear that Congress has not taken a position on the theses put forward during the more than three-hour session. Believing or not was up to each member of the legislative body, but those who testified had to swear an oath to tell the truth.

Gutiérrez Luna stressed the importance of listening to ""all voices, all opinions"" and said it was positive that there was a transparent dialogue on the issue of extraterrestrials.

Earlier this year, a former U.S. intelligence community official testified on an alleged covert government program to recover and reverse engineer crashed alien spacecraft.

David Grusch, a member of a previous Pentagon office tasked with investigating UAPs, said he was informed of the alleged multi-decade program through his official duties, but was denied access to additional information.

A former intelligence community official testified Wednesday on an alleged covert government program to recover and reverse engineer crashed alien spacecraft.

The Pentagon said in June it hadn't found ""any verifiable information to substantiate"" the claims about crashed alien spacecraft.

The remarks came during a bipartisan hearing held by the House Oversight Committee's national security subcommittee. The three witnesses included Grusch, David Fravor, a former commanding officer in the U.S. Navy, and Ryan Graves, executive director of Americans for Safe Aerospace.

Members of both parties stressed the need for greater clarity on UAPs. Many voiced concerns that unidentified aerial objects pose to national security.

319,2023/09/13, 'mitt romney',https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/13/politics/mitt-romney-not-running-reelection/index.html,"CNN —

Utah Republican Sen. Mitt Romney announced Wednesday that he will not run for reelection to the Senate and called for a “new generation of leaders” as he criticized both President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump.

In a video message, Romney outlined a range of what he described as critical issues, including rising national debt and the climate crisis, and said “neither President Biden nor former President Trump are leading their party to confront those issues.”

The Utah Republican’s decision will mark the departure of a distinctive voice from the Senate of a lawmaker willing to take on his own party. Romney, who was the 2012 GOP presidential nominee, has long been a rare member of the Republican party who has been an outspoken critic of Trump.

In 2020, Romney found Trump guilty of abuse of power during Trump’s first impeachment trial in the Senate, becoming the first senator in US history to vote to remove from office a president from the same party.

At a time when the age of prominent politicians on both sides of the aisle has come under increasing scrutiny, Romney also emphasized the need for a new generation of leadership.

“At the end of another term, I’d be in my mid-80s,” Romney, who is 76, said. “Frankly, it’s time for a new generation of leaders. They’re the ones that need to make the decisions that will shape the world they will be living in.”

“While I’m not running for reelection, I’m not retiring from the fight,” Romney said, after criticizing both Biden and Trump for failing to provide solutions to issues like the national debt and global warming. “I’ll be your United States senator until January of 2025.”

Romney heavily criticized his Senate Republican colleagues for their continued loyalty to Trump, saying, “A very large portion of my party really doesn’t believe in the Constitution,” in an excerpt published Wednesday from his upcoming biography by McKay Coppins. The excerpt, which was printed in the Atlantic, details Romney’s experience in the U.S. Senate, including his decision to not run for reelection in 2024.

Coppins recounts Romney’s experience on January 6, 2021, including the near miss where he almost walked in to a crowd of oncoming rioters, and his shock at the “disingenuousness” of his colleagues that continued to object during the electoral college proceedings. “‘They know better! Josh Hawley is one of the smartest people in the Senate, if not the smartest, and Ted Cruz could give him a run for his money,’” Romney told Coppins. As for his newer colleagues, Romney said, “’I don’t know that I can disrespect someone more than J.D. Vance.’”

Coppins says Romney also told him that other Republican senators that ended up voting to acquit Trump in his second impeachment trial changed their minds out of fear for their safety and the safety of their families.

Romney also acknowledged his concerns about Biden’s age in the next election, telling Coppins, “I was afraid that Biden, in his advanced years, would be incapable of making the argument.” He said he had a pipe dream of running again, just to push back on Trump’s rhetoric, and had even approached Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia about forming a third party.

Romney has had a prominent career on the national stage in American politics in addition to his time spent serving in the Senate. He ran as the Republican Party nominee in the 2012 presidential race and lost to Barack Obama, who was then the Democratic incumbent. Romney also served as the governor of the state of Massachusetts from 2003 to 2007.

In making his announcement, Romney outlined the issues he sees with both Trump and Biden.

“On deficits and debt, both men refuse to address entitlements even though they know that this represents two-thirds of federal spending. Donald Trump calls global warming a hoax, and President Biden offers feel-good solutions that make no difference to the global climate. On China, President Biden underinvests in the military and President Trump underinvests in our alliances,” he said.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell praised Romney in a statement reacting to the news.

“The US Senate is known to attract bright and proven public servants. However, we rarely get to welcome new Senators already as accomplished and well-regarded as Mitt Romney. The Senate has been fortunate to call our friend from Utah a colleague these past four and a half years, and I am sorry to learn that he will depart our ranks at the end of next year,” McConnell said, adding, “I know the Senate is relieved that we will continue to benefit from Senator Romney’s expertise throughout the coming year.”

The boyband reunited during the 2023 MTV Video Music Awards Tuesday night to the delight of '80s and '90s kids across the country.

The five-piece group consisting of Justin Timberlake, Lance Bass, Joey Fatone, Chris Kirkpatrick and JC Chasez took to the stage to present the best pop award. The winner was none other than Taylor Swift, a fan herself who was visibly excited as she accepted the award.

""I had your dolls,"" she told the former boy band members. ""What’s going to happen now? They’re doing something and I need to know what it is. You’re pop personified.""

NSYNC hasn't released new music in two decades. After several years of chart-topping hits, the band's fourth and last album, ""Celebrity,"" released in 2001. They went on hiatus the following year, which is also when Timberlake's Grammy-winning debut solo album, ""Justified,"" released.

Reunion rumors started swirling recently when promotional materials for the next ""Trolls"" franchise installment, ""Trolls Band Together"" — which Timberlake stars in — appeared to tease a new *NSYNC song on its soundtrack. Prior to this, the group came back together to celebrate their Hollywood Walk Of Fame star in 2018.

In 2013, Fatone, Chasez, Bass and Kirkpatrick joined Timberlake to perform ""Girlfriend"" and ""Bye, Bye, Bye"" in celebration of Timberlake receiving an MTV VMA Vanguard Award.

Deion Sanders won't have a hard time making Colorado's rivalry game this week against Colorado State feel ""personal.""

Rams coach Jay Norvell took a shot at Sanders' habit of wearing a hat and/or sunglasses during news conferences, saying Wednesday during his weekly radio show: ""I don't care if they hear this in Boulder. I told them [ESPN] -- I took my hat off, and I took my glasses off. I said, 'When I talk to grown-ups, I take my hat and my glasses off. That's what my mother taught me.'""

The comments drew applause from the live audience and the show's host, Colorado State football radio voice Brian Roth, and it didn't take long for the remarks to make their way to Sanders.

In a video titled ""Coach Prime & The CU Buffs Responds to Lil Bro,"" posted Thursday to YouTube by Well Off Media, which is run by Deion Sanders Jr., the Colorado coach is shown addressing his team at practice.

""I'm minding my own business watching some film, trying to get ready, trying to get out here and be the best coach that I could be, and I look up and I read some bull junk that they had said about us, once again,"" Sanders told the team. ""Why would you want to talk about us when we don't talk about nobody? All we do is go out here, work our butts off and do our job on Saturday. But when they give us ammunition, they done messed around and made it [personal].

""It was just gonna be a good game and they done messed around and made it personal. It was gonna be a great task -- a battle of Colorado -- but they done messed around and made it [personal].""

Later in the video, Sanders is shown on a golf cart at practice, saying, ""Now he's messing with my mama,"" referring to Norvell's comment about how he was raised.

In his weekly show, Norvell initially said he did not ""really want to talk about [Sanders] right now."" But as the interview progressed, Norvell opened up about the attention this week's rivalry matchup has generated, including a visit from ESPN's ""College GameDay.""

As part of GameDay's visit, Norvell and multiple Rams players did on-camera interviews.

""It was great. I loved it,"" Norvell said of the added attention. ""But our kids came out of those [interviews] really with a chip on their shoulder. They're tired of all that stuff. They really are tired of it.

""They're [Colorado] not gonna like us no matter what we say or do. It doesn't matter. So, let's go up there and play. That's just how I feel about it.""

Sanders, who is in his first season as Colorado's coach, has made it clear over the past two weeks that the Buffaloes have been keeping tabs on what has been said about the former NFL star and his program.

""I keep the receipts,"" Sanders said after the Buffaloes' season-opening victory against TCU.

Sanders told his team last week that their game against Nebraska was ""personal."" Shedeur Sanders, the Buffaloes' quarterback and son of Deion Sanders, said after Colorado's 36-14 victory that he didn't respect Nebraska coach Matt Rhule because, in part, ""[Rhule] said a lot of things about my pops, about the program.""

The commentary about the Buffaloes was not all negative from Norvell, who was complimentary of the job Sanders has done turning Colorado around so quickly. Norvell also highlighted Shedeur Sanders' play.

""They got a good football team, and their quarterback has been the difference,"" Norvell said. ""He's playing at a very high level. We're gonna have to slow him down.""

Norvell was even more complimentary of Coach Sanders earlier in the week during his weekly news conference.

""Deion Sanders has had a lot of public critics. I'm not one of them,"" Norvell told reporters, according to The Coloradoan. ""I really respect all head coaches and the sacrifices they've had to make to become head coaches, and I appreciate the path they have to go through to get there -- especially African American coaches. I was happy to see Deion get his opportunity. I had to wait a long time to get mine.""

Colorado (2-0) already has doubled its win total from last season and enters Saturday's Rocky Mountain Showdown game ranked No. 18 in the Associated Press poll. Colorado State (0-1) lost its season opener, 50-24, to Washington State.

The Buffaloes and Rams last played Aug. 30, 2019, and Colorado has won five straight in the series. The Rams' last victory over the Buffaloes was in 2014, and they have lost 23 straight games against AP Top 25 teams. Their last road win over a ranked team was in 1998.

323,2023/09/14, 'thursday night football',https://www.espn.com/sports-betting/story/_/id/38393217/philadelphia-eagles-minnesota-vikings-thursday-night-nfl-betting-odds-picks-tips,"Week 2 offers quite the ""Thursday Night Football"" matchup with Minnesota Vikings heading on the road to face the Philadelphia Eagles (-6, 49) at Lincoln Financial Field. The Eagles are coming off a narrow 25-20 road victory over New England in Week 1, while the Vikings are looking to avoid the dreaded 0-2 start following a 20-17 season-opening home loss to Tampa Bay.

What can we expect from a betting standpoint for Thursday night's game?

Betting analysts Tyler Fulghum, Erin Dolan, Eric Moody, Seth Walder and Anita Marks are here to provide their thoughts.

Note: Lines from Caesars Sportsbook unless otherwise indicated.

How much do you weigh Week 1's results and the Vikings trying to avoid 0-2 in this one?

Moody: It carries significant weight. When you look at the numbers it is very difficult for 0-2 teams to make the playoffs. The Vikings' game against the Buccaneers last week was a huge disappointment. The Vikings have a very good quarterback in Kirk Cousins, and one of the best wide receiver duos in Justin Jefferson and Jordan Addison, but lost at home to Baker Mayfield and the Buccaneers. We'll see Minnesota's desperation on Thursday night as they try to avoid an 0-2 start. Against a Philadelphia defense that has five new starters and a new defensive coordinator, I do believe the Vikings will cover the spread. Last season, the Eagles were 3-4 against the spread when they were favored by six points or more.

Fulghum: It definitely carries some weight. If Minnesota had taken care of business against Tampa Bay as almost a TD favorite, I'm not sure we'd have to lay a full 6 points with Philadelphia in this matchup. Is it a buy-low spot on the Vikings who will be ""desperate"" to avoid the 0-2 start? Maybe. Ultimately, I do believe Philadelphia is the better team and will win the game, but because the Vikings can play so much better than they did against the Bucs I think it could be a close, competitive game. I advise using the Eagles as one leg in a 6-point teaser. Move through the key numbers of 6-4-3 and create a spread where you're just asking them to win the game.

Walder: Some weight, though I would say both teams were a little disappointing in Week 1. The difference, though, is in who they were playing. I think we might look back on New England as being a little feisty, and I don't see that with the Bucs at all. So Week 1 was worse for Minnesota, certainly.

The Eagles won a tight game in Week 1, while the Cowboys and 49ers dominated their opponents. Do the performances by NFC contenders change how you view the Eagles in Futures markets?

Dolan: Not necessarily. It was one week and everything is a case-by-case basis. The 49ers performance surprised me most. Brock Purdy showed that he is capable at stepping up as a quarterback and that offense is no joke, and neither is the defense. The Cowboys had the most jarring box score of Week 1, but I think that is a one-off performance. Eagles got the win on the road (and covered the spread) against one of the greatest coaches of all time. There is a reason the Eagles and 49ers are tied with the Chiefs at +700 to win the Super Bowl.

Fulghum: Not at all. San Francisco, Philadelphia and Dallas are the three best teams in the NFC. The only thing, in my opinion, that will change that belief over the course of the season is injury.

Despite winning 13 games last year, the Vikings didn't enter the season as NFC North favorites and then lost at home to Tampa Bay on Sunday. How concerned are you about Minnesota as they face an elite team on short rest?

Walder: I guess in the context of their win total last year, extremely concerned? I don't think anyone paying close attention -- including the Vikings themselves, if you look at their offseason! -- considered them anywhere close to a 13-win team last year. They were mediocre, which is what they are now. Fans and bettors should not be thinking of Minnesota as a playoff-caliber team.

Justin Jefferson's receiving prop is 6.5 catches in this game, and A.J. Brown's is 5.5 catches. Jefferson hauled in nine receptions in Week 1, and Brown caught seven. Are either/both of these bets on your radar?

Moody: Brown's 5.5 receptions caught my eye, but DeVonta Smith over 5.5 receptions at plus odds is intriguing. The Vikings defense gave up 265.5 passing yards per game last season and ranked dead last in the league in completions per game. Jalen Hurts is much more talented than Buccaneers quarterback Baker Mayfield. The Vikings don't have much talent for new defensive coordinator Brian Flores to work with in the secondary. Smith has averaged 5.6 receptions and has a 70.3% catch rate over the last 18 games.

Fulghum: They are both on my radar. Jefferson is always a threat to see 12+ targets in a game. And as we saw in Week 1, when the Eagles are in a tight game they will keep putting the ball in the air and targeting their co-alpha WRs. I expect this game to follow a similar script. I don't think we see the type of game script that so many Philadelphia games followed last year where they have such a big lead in the second half that they rarely throw the football. Jefferson, Brown and Smith are all appealing fantasy options for Week 2. This game, with a 49.0 total, is ripe for offensive production.

Marks: Brown's OVER 5.5 receptions is on my radar. New defensive coordinator Brian Flores is blitz happy; last year with the Steelers, he blitzed the Eagles 60% of the time and last week vs. Baker and the Bucs he blitzed 47% of the time. When Hurts gets blitzed, he targets Brown 32% of the time. The Vikings secondary allowed the Bucs' wideouts to have 11 receptions for 121 yards. Brown should see a lot of action Thursday evening.

Is there anything else you are playing on Thursday?

Dolan: Kirk Cousins OVER 37.5 passing attempts. Cousins should be airing the ball out in this prime-time matchup. Last season in a Week 2 prime-time matchup against the Eagles, Cousins had 46 passing attempts in a 24-7 road loss. Cousins was trying to crawl back in that game. In Minnesota's Week 1 loss to Tampa Bay, he went 33 for 44 with two passing touchdowns and one interception. The Vikings leaned on the passing game rather than the running game with Alexander Mattison posting 34 rushing yards. Minnesota was trying to stay in that game. Mac Jones had 54 passing attempts in the Week 1 loss to the Eagles with the point being, the Patriots had to crawl back in that game. I expect Cousins to be playing from behind in this one, which will force him to throw the ball more. You like that?

Fulghum: T.J. Hockenson OVER 48.5 receiving yards. The Eagles have long been a defense that is OK allowing production to opposing TEs. In Week 1, Hunter Henry caught 5 of 6 targets for 56 yards and a TD against Philadelphia. While Hockenson mustered only 35 yards against the Buccaneers, he did see nine targets and haul in eight receptions. If he sees that type of target volume against Philadelphia, he should see a boost in efficiency to go along with it.

Moody: Jalen Hurts OVER 45.5 rushing yards. The Eagles weren't at their best on the road in the season opener against the Patriots. In their home opener on Thursday night, Philadelphia is sure to get back in rhythm. Hurts rushed for 57 yards on 11 carries last season against the Vikings. He averaged 50.7 rushing yards in 2022. Hurts is well-positioned to meet or exceed those per game averages on Thursday night.

Marks: Kirk Cousins OVER 37.5 passing attempts. 89% of the Vikings yards came through the air in Week 1 and I expect more of the same Thursday night. The Eagles defensive line is healthy but their secondary is not. Cousins has a plethora of offensive options to work with in the passing game and will be the only way the Vikings stay lockstep with the Eagles.

Marks: T.J. Hockenson OVER 4.5 receptions. Hockenson is a big part of the Vikings passing game this season. He saw nine targets and hauled in eight receptions along with a TD in Week 1. The Eagles will be without LB Nakobe Dean, S Reed Blankenship and CB James Bradberry -- this will open up plenty of opportunities for the TE."
324,2023/09/14, 'arm stock',https://www.cnbc.com/2023/09/14/arm-ipo-arm-starts-trading-on-the-nasdaq-in-win-for-softbank.html,"Arm CEO Rene Haas and executives cheer as Softbank's Arm, a chip design firm, holds an initial public offering at the Nasdaq MarketSite in New York, Sept. 14, 2023.

Arm Chief Financial Officer Jason Child told CNBC in an interview that the company is focusing on royalty growth and providing products to its customers that cost and do more.

It's a hefty premium for the British chip company. At a $60 billion valuation, Arm's price-to-earnings multiple would be over 110 based on the most recent fiscal year profit. That's comparable to Nvidia's valuation, which trades at 108 times earnings, but without Nvidia's 170% growth forecast for the current quarter.

On Wednesday, Arm priced shares at the upper end of its expected range. On Thursday, the stock first traded at $56.10 and ended the day at $63.59.

At the open, Arm was valued at almost $60 billion. The company, trading under ticker symbol ""ARM,"" sold about 95.5 million shares. SoftBank, which took the company private in 2016, controls about 90% of shares outstanding.

Arm Holdings , the chip design company controlled by SoftBank , jumped nearly 25% during its first day of trading Thursday after selling shares at $51 a piece in its initial public offering.

Many of Arm's royalties come from products released decades ago. About half the company's royalty revenue, which totaled $1.68 billion in 2022, comes from products released between 1990 and 2012.

""As a CFO, it's one of the better business models I've seen. I joke sometimes that those older products are like the Beatles catalog, they just keep delivering royalties. Some of those products are three decades old,"" Child said.

In a presentation to investors, Arm said it expects the total market for its chip designs to be worth about $250 billion by 2025, including growth in chip designs for data centers and cars. Arm's revenue in its fiscal year that ended in March slipped less than 1% from the prior year to $2.68 billion.

Arm's architecture is used in nearly every smartphone chip and outlines how a central processor works at its most basic level, such as doing arithmetic or accessing computer memory.

Child said the company sold $735 million in shares to a group of strategic investors comprising Apple, Google, Nvidia, Samsung, AMD, Intel, Cadence, Synopsis, Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. It's a testament to Arm's influence among chip companies, which rely on Arm's technology to design and build their own chips.

""There was interest to buy more than what was indicated, but we wanted to make sure we had a diverse set of shareholders,"" Child said.

In an interview with CNBC on Thursday, SoftBank CEO Masayoshi Son emphasized how Arm's technology is used in artificial intelligence chips, as he seeks to tie the firm to the recent boom in AI and machine learning. He also said he wanted to keep the company's remaining Arm stake as long as possible.

The debut could kick open the market for technology IPOs, which have been paused for nearly two years. It's the biggest technology offering of 2023."

He went from Georgia walk-on to transferring to junior college, transferring back to Georgia and then helping lead the Bulldogs to consecutive College Football Playoff national championships in the 2021 and 2022 seasons. Bennett, a 2022 Heisman Trophy finalist, did enough in his senior season at Georgia to be selected 128th overall, in the fourth round, of the 2023 NFL Draft.

Now, his professional football journey is on pause as the Rams placed him on the reserve/non-football injury list Wednesday. That means he is not suiting up with the team for an undisclosed reason, not involving an injury on the field. The team also made a notable transaction at the quarterback position by signing Brett Rypien to the 53-man roster to serve as Matthew Stafford's backup, according to CBS Sports NFL Insider Jonathan Jones.

Rams head coach Sean McVay refused to get into any specifics about Bennett's situation at his press conference on Wednesday, describing what's going on with the 25-year-old rookie as ""bigger than football.""

""I'm not going to have any follow-up information or anything that I will give in that regard,"" McVay said when asked about Bennett's status. ""I really hope that you can please respect my wishes and regards to keeping that in-house. I understand you have a job to do, but there are certain things that are a little bigger and a little more important than the particulars and the specifics. We want to keep it in-house, and that's where I want to leave it please.""

When asked how Bennett's absence could impact the quarterback room behind the 35-year-old Stafford, McVay went right back to his company line about Bennett's situation being bigger than football.

""I think there are certain things a lot bigger than that [the Rams' quarterback room situation],"" McVay said. ""The fortunate thing for us is Brett Rypien has been with us in-house. He is on our practice squad. He was the backup last week, and he is going to continue to be in that spot until anything changes on that note [Bennett's situation]. That's where we are at right now.""

Rypien, the 27-year-old undrafted free agent who is also the nephew of Super Bowl-winning quarterback Mark Rypien, bounced on and off of the Denver Broncos roster from 2019 to 2022. The Rams signed him to a one-year deal in free agency this past offseason, released him on roster cutdown day and then signed him to their practice squad on Aug. 11. He was elevated from the practice unit to serve as the backup in Week 1 and now that move is more permanent with him being signed to the 53-man squad going forward.

Given that Stafford suffered multiple injuries in 2022 with his neck as well as a concussion that caused him to miss eight games, having a reliable player behind him just in case of emergency is of importance for the 1-0 Rams."
329,2023/09/14, 'dwts cast 2023',https://ew.com/tv/dancing-with-the-stars-season-32-cast-preview/,"It's time to go back to the ballroom.

On Wednesday morning, ABC announced the season 32 cast of Dancing With the Stars on Good Morning America. Joining previously announced cast members Mira Sorvino, Ariana Madix, Charity Lawson, and Jamie Lynn Spears are the likes of Marvel actress Xochitl Gomez, How I Met Your Mother star Alyson Hannigan, and NFL star Adrian Peterson.

""There's something for everyone in this cast,"" says executive producer Conrad Green. ""What's interesting with a lot of our contestants this year is this real drive and excitement about doing it. There's a real passion for it. It's been a tough number of years, one way or another with the strikes going on and all these things. So what I'm hoping we can bring to people is bringing Dancing back and giving audiences a blast of sunshine early in the week.""

There is, of course, the looming question of the ongoing dual strikes, which have kept both WGA members and SAG-AFTRA performers on the picket lines throughout the summer. As a reality show, Dancing With the Stars is on a separate contract from the struck work that actors cannot participate in at this time.

""Everyone is welcome to work on the show,"" notes Green. ""We are one of the few things that is legitimate for people to work on, and it's sanctioned by the union. It's a really difficult time for the whole industry at the moment and so many people are struggling, but it is nice to be in a position to be able to continue to work and to be able to make a show.""

'Dancing With the Stars'. Disney+

There's no shortage of changes on Dancing this year. After Tyra Banks' exit, Alfonso Ribeiro will return as a host, stepping onto the main stage, while former Dancing pro Julianne Hough joins to take over Ribeiro's former cohost slot in the Sky Box.

""Julianne was definitely our first choice,"" gushes Green. ""Alfonso coming on last season really proved that there's an understanding that comes with having been on the show and being part of the family of the show that connects well with the audience and makes you really understand what the celebrities and dancers are going through. It's going to be really interesting to have someone asking questions in the Sky Box who has been on both sides of the fence as a dancer and has seen everything. She's been on the opposite side of those questions. She understands what it's like to teach. There's so much insight that she brings.""

Additionally, the fact that Ribeiro and Hough have both brought their moves to the ballroom before means that we might even see the hosts participate in some of the group numbers. ""It gives us the option to do little bits of performance with them or have them involved in opening numbers and things,"" notes Green. ""They've both got the ability to dance. So it's a real fresh take on what you can do with hosts on the show.""

Though Green is largely mum on what some of this year's themes might be, he does reveal that they're working on a potential Music Videos Night. ""What we want to do is challenge people to base their routine on a classic music video,"" he says. ""Maybe incorporate some of the choreography or styling. It's a bit nostalgic, but it's also a little bit of a dance challenge as well.""

The show is also back in its original home, airing live on ABC, after being solely available on Disney+ last season (where it will now stream concurrently). ""You never want to leave your audience behind,"" notes Green of returning to network television. ""To be able to come back on to ABC is brilliant. It's the best of all worlds. Now we've got Disney+, we've got Hulu, and we've got ABC. We're covering all the bases.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Google/Screenshot by NPR Google/Screenshot by NPR

To kick off Hispanic Heritage Month, Google is celebrating Luisa Moreno, a Guatemalan-American journalist turned labor organizer who united and mobilized Spanish-speaking communities in the U.S. around worker's rights nearly a century ago.

Friday's Google Doodle depicts Moreno holding a megaphone and linking arms with a group of people. The artist behind the illustration, Juliet Menéndez, who is also Guatemalan-American, told NPR she wanted to represent Moreno's work in rallying people of different races and classes.

""As an immigrant, she came in and brought so many people in the United States together,"" Menéndez said. ""She did a lot to bring the Latinx community together, at a time when it wasn't defined as such.""

Menéndez added that the imagery of linked arms was intentional to symbolize the strength that lies in solidarity, as well as to nod to protesting. She also included the scales of justice and hints of yellow as metaphors to Moreno's commitment to integrity and shedding light on truth. Sprouting out of the megaphone are dandelions.

""In dandelions, when you blow them, the seeds spread far and wide,"" Menéndez said. ""I wanted to show that she planted the seeds of the American labor movement.""

Moreno advocated for tobacco and food industry workers

Born in Guatemala in the early 1900s (variously reported as 1906 0r 1907), Moreno began organizing as a teenager after learning that women in her country were not allowed to attend university. She protested and lobbied for women to have greater access to higher education. Eventually, the campaign was successful, according to Google.

After a brief stint in journalism, Moreno, still in her 20s, moved to New York City. Incidents of police brutality against Latino protesters there, as well as poor working conditions in garment factories, spurred her return to activism.

In 1935, she became a professional organizer with the American Federation of Labor and advocated for workers across the country, particularly in the food and tobacco industries. Six years later, Moreno was elected vice president of the United Cannery, Agricultural, Packing and Allied Workers of America.

Moreno's most pivotal work included her efforts to unify the Latino community. In 1938, she founded the El Congreso del Pueblo de Habla Española, or National Congress of Spanish-Speaking Peoples, considered one of the first national efforts to mobilize people from Spanish-speaking countries in the fight for improved working conditions and fair treatment for all Latino laborers.

The federal government eventually took notice of Moreno's success as a labor leader and began threatening to deport her, according to a pamphlet describing Moreno's situation and circulated around 1949.

""They can talk about deporting me, but they can never deport the people that I've worked with and with whom things were accomplished for the benefit of hundreds of thousands of workers,"" Moreno said in the pamphlet, later obtained by the National Museum of American History.

Forced to leave the U.S., Moreno returned to Latin America in 1950, where she continued to organize in Mexico, Cuba and Guatemala. She died in 1992."

The couple have been married since 2021.

Rapper Jeezy and television host Jeannie Mai are divorcing.

Jeezy, whose real name is Jay Wayne Jenkins, filed for divorce from Mai on Thursday at an Atlanta courthouse after two years of marriage.

According to the filing, the rapper said ""the marriage is irretrievably broken"" and ""there is no hope for reconciliation."" Jeezy and Mai both have a prenup in place.

""Good Morning America"" has reached out to Jeezy's and Mai's reps for comment.

The couple began dating after they met on Mai’s talk show ""The Real"" in 2018. During an episode of ""The Real"" in 2019, Mai opened up about her relationship with Jeezy.

""Getting to know him has been one of the most beautiful experiences of my life,"" Mai said about the rapper at the time. ""He’s introspective, he’s passionate, he’s incredibly deep, he’s a visionary, he’s a great leader, he’s an amazing servant to his community.""

""I found my equal,"" she added. ""I really got to know him just off our first date. We’re in our 40s. God somehow managed our timing.""

In April 2020, Jeezy popped the question to Mai.

""I want nothing more than to spend the rest of my life loving you,"" Mai wrote on Instagram. “YES.”

They tied the knot in March 2021. Six months later, they announced they were expecting their first child together.

Mai and Jeezy welcomed their daughter Monaco Mai-Jenkins in January 2022.

Jeezy said he ""desires"" that their daughter will ""share joint legal custody"" on a ""temporary and permanent basis."""

The Australian actors married in 1996 and have two children, Oscar, 23, and Ava, 18.

In a statement to People magazine, the couple said: “We have been blessed to share almost three decades together as husband and wife in a wonderful, loving marriage. Our journey now is shifting and we have decided to separate to pursue our individual growth.

“Our family has been and always will be our highest priority. We undertake this next chapter with gratitude, love, and kindness. We greatly appreciate your understanding in respecting our privacy as our family navigates this transition in all of our lives.”

The statement was signed off as “Deb and Hugh Jackman”, with the addendum: “This is the sole statement either of us will make.”

The couple had celebrated their 27th wedding anniversary in April. They met while co-starring as a prison psychologist and a brain-damaged convict in Australian television series Correlli in 1995.

Furness most recently played Jill Bailey alongside Eric Bana in the Australian thriller Force of Nature: The Dry 2, from writer-director Robert Connolly.

Jackman is known for playing Wolverine in the X-Men franchise and has also starred in The Greatest Showman and Les Miserables on screen. His stage roles include The Music Man on Broadway.

In 2000, the couple adopted Oscar Maximilian, now 23. Five years later, they adopted now 18-year-old daughter Ava Eliot.

In an interview with Smooth Radio in February, Jackman was asked about how to have a long-lasting marriage.

“I think honesty and intimacy and making time [are the secret to a long and happy marriage]. You can’t just assume that things will just tick along OK. You have to make time.”

In an interview in 2017 to promote The Greatest Showman, he described Deborra-Lee as his “best friend” and main source of support in his career and personal life.

Earlier this week, Jackman advocated the 85% rule as something that he tries to live by to prevent burnout.

In an interview with the American entrepreneur Tim Ferriss, the actor explained that professional sports players often worked at 85 per cent of capacity to focus on their form and optimisation."
333,2023/09/15, 'eagles score',https://theathletic.com/live-blogs/eagles-vs-vikings-tnf-live-score-updates-result/i7dvOLw3xXVv/,"PHILADELPHIA — The Philadelphia Eagles went from hot to cold on offense, and then did just enough to earn a narrow win over the New England Patriots on Sunday in their regular-season opener. Four days later, they seemed headed for more of the same.

“Sloppy” was how coordinator Brian Johnson described the operation of his Week 1 offense, with the first-year play caller including himself in the assessment. The sloppiness continued in the first quarter Thursday night, when the Eagles faced the Minnesota Vikings at Lincoln Financial Field. Philadelphia converted just 1 of 5 third downs, turned the ball over on an interception and failed to cash in on two fumble recoveries for any points.

You would have never expected the eventual offensive eruption that helped the Eagles to a 34-28 victory. Philadelphia finished with 430 yards of offense and at one point led the Vikings by 20 points.

Everything changed early in the second quarter, thanks to a somewhat unlikely hero and two of the Eagles’ strongest units.

The Eagles turned to running back D’Andre Swift, the Philadelphia native who went largely overlooked with just one carry for 3 yards against New England in Week 1. They also put the game on the backs of their offensive and defensive lines, the units in which the front office has invested most heavily and consistently. After that, the Eagles finally found a rhythm.

It started with a 16-play, 75-yard offensive drive that featured 13 runs — including nine by Swift for 45 yards — and was capped by the Eagles’ signature Jalen Hurts goal-line sneak. It continued with a disruptive defensive showing that bottled up the Vikings rushing attack, hurried quarterback Kirk Cousins frequently and finished with a total of four takeaways.

And the train kept on rolling: Swift rushed for a career-high 175 yards and a touchdown on 28 attempts to spearhead a 259-yard rushing day for the Eagles (2-0) as a whole.

REUTERS/Rebecca Cook/File Photo Acquire Licensing Rights

Sept 15 (Reuters) - A walkout by more than 12,000 autoworkers on Friday could slow an outperforming U.S. economy should it drag on - even risking the first monthly net drop in payroll employment in nearly three years - but is unlikely on its own to trigger a recession.

Economists see the most immediate risk to activity concentrated in the auto sector itself, which only this year got back on its feet after two years when pandemic-related supply chain bottlenecks hampered vehicle output. With dealer inventories restrained, sales of new cars and trucks had slumped over much of that period even as consumer demand remained strong.

After failing to reach a deal on a new contract with Detroit's ""Big Three"" automakers General Motors (GM.N), Ford (F.N) and Stellantis (STLAM.MI), the United Auto Workers union went on strike on Friday at three plants in three states. The stoppage for now affects about 12,700 hourly employees.

Should it widen in the weeks ahead to include all 146,000 UAW members at the three companies, it could become the largest automotive industry strike in a quarter century - since more than 150,000 GM workers went off the job for nearly two months in 1998.

That would put ""at risk half a billion dollars per day in an economy that generates more than $26.7 trillion in goods and services each year, or more than $73 billion per day,"" RSM's chief U.S. economist Joe Brusuelas estimated this week.

RSM estimates the U.S. economy would suffer a modest 0.2% drag to annualized growth of gross domestic product this quarter should the strike action last for a month, Brusuelas said.

""While that amount is large in nominal dollar terms, it would not be large enough to tip the economy into recession. In the end, the impact of a such a strike would be modest compared to previous generations,"" Brusuelas said.

Other economists offered comparable estimates of the potential drag from a prolonged strike by the Big Three's full union membership.

RISK TO PAYROLLS

The U.S. economy this year has dodged what was a consensus expectation for falling into recession in the face of aggressive interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve to rein in the highest inflation in four decades.

In fact, growth in GDP - the broadest measure of economic output - motored along at an above-trend rate of just above 2% annualized through the first six months of the year, and indicators of activity so far in the third quarter suggest it has accelerated further.

That said, activity in some sectors - manufacturing in particular - has recently slowed or even stalled, and a historically hot job market has cooled over the summer.

A full-blown strike ""could push U.S. payroll growth temporarily negative,"" Michael Pearce, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, wrote on Wednesday.

While this was the survey week for the Labor Department's monthly nonfarm payrolls report for September, the fact that union members were on the job for most of the week ahead of the walkout means they will be counted as employed for this month's report, Pearce said. That means any recorded knock to employment would likely not occur until October, should the strike last that long, and that would not be reported until early November.

The UAW walkout in June and July of 1998 resulted in a net drop of 136,000 jobs in the auto sector, BLS data shows, but with job growth at that time was averaging more than 270,000 a month, it was not enough to drag total employment growth into negative territory.

It may be a different story this time, however. In the three months through August, net payroll growth had slowed to an average of around 150,000 a month - from 430,000 a month over the summer of 2022 - so a full walkout poses the risk of the first net drop in U.S. payrolls since December 2020.

Pearce also estimated a full strike lasting a month could cut U.S. auto output by nearly a third, much as it did during the 1998 strike. That could knock monthly assembly rates back to near their lows from two years ago around this time when severe shortages of microchips and other components stifled Detroit's output.

In fact, the pace of production weakened in August before the strike, new data from the Fed showed on Friday hours after the walkout began. Assemblies of cars and light trucks fell by about 9% last month, the largest drop since the post-pandemic output low in September 2021.

The auto sector's slowdown was a significant drag on overall U.S. factory output last month, which notched only a fractional gain of 0.1%.

336,2023/09/16,'post-tropical cyclone lee',https://www.foxweather.com/weather-news/post-tropical-cyclone-lee-new-england-hurricane-impacts,"BAR HARBOR, Maine – A second death related to Lee in the U.S. was reported Saturday as the sprawling storm pounded New England with damaging winds that left more 300,000 customers across both the U.S. and Canada without power during the peak of the cyclone.

The first death happened in Florida earlier this week when then-Hurricane Lee churned up dangerous rip currents that officials said led to the drowning of a 15-year-old swimmer. On Saturday, police said winds from Post-Tropical Cyclone Lee knocked down a tree onto a car in Searsport, Maine, and killed a 50-year-old man inside.

According to the National Hurricane Center, the storm came ashore on Long Island off Nova Scotia, Canada, with winds of about 70 mph. While the name of Lee changed from ""hurricane"" to ""post-tropical cyclone,"" the difference for those in New England is in title only.

The storm is now getting its power from more traditional atmospheric clashes between warm and cold air, and no longer drawing energy from warm waters below like hurricanes and tropical storms, the FOX Forecast Center said.

The vast majority of power outages in the U.S. were in Maine, but restoration crews have made steady progress, with outages dipping to around 50,000 around midnight.

PowerOutage.com reported the provinces of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island were the hardest in Canada with outages topping 200,000 on Saturday.

Cell phone service was also reported to be spotty in the region, which was likely a result of widespread power outages.

On Saturday morning, FOX Weather meteorologist Michael Estime was covering the storm from Bar Harbor, Maine, when he witnessed a boat being forcefully propelled by strong waves towards a concrete pier before it slammed into a seawall.

""We watched as one of these boats … became unhinged and the boat was rocking and rolling … and within 30 seconds that wind took that boat and smacked it up against the seawall right behind Pier No. 2, and then we lost it as it sailed out of our field of vision,"" he said.

In Manasquan, New Jersey, a boat capsized Friday night due to Lee's high waves and rough surf, causing a man to go missing. The area experienced 8- to 10-foot waves during the incident, leading to the 31-foot boat's overturning. A father and his two sons were onboard, and the father and one son were rescued. Coast Guard and local agencies searched until sunset Friday for the son still missing. The search was suspended pending further developments.

Week 4 of the college football season is upon us and with it comes the start of conference play for most leagues and matchups of unbeaten teams.

There are eight matchups between teams that are 3-0 or better Saturday, the most in a single day since the FBS/FCS split in 1978, according to ESPN Stats & Information research.

The most anticipated of those games games: No. 6 Ohio State travels to South Bend to take on No. 9 Notre Dame (7:30 p.m. ET, NBC), and No. 19 Colorado faces a huge test at No. 10 Oregon (3:30 p.m. ET, ABC).

In Saturday's other battles of unbeaten teams, Rutgers plays No. 2 Michigan at the Big House (noon ET, Big Ten Network), No. 22 UCLA is at No. 11 Utah (3:30 p.m. ET, Fox), No. 14 Oregon State travels to No. 21 Washington State (7 p.m. ET, Fox), No. 24 Iowa goes to Happy Valley to face No. 7 Penn State (7:30 p.m. ET, CBS), BYU is at Kansas (3:30 p.m. ET, ESPN) and Memphis visits Missouri (7:30 p.m. ET, ESPNU).

Our reporters preview Week 4 with a look at which teams have something to prove, defenses to watch and some of the week's best quotes.

Who has something to prove as conference play ramps up?

Florida State needs to keep its focus if the Seminoles are going to beat Clemson on Saturday. Fred Kfoury III/Icon Sportswire

Florida State: Seminoles coach Mike Norvell acknowledges his team was missing an edge last week against Boston College and lost focus after building a 21-point lead. The Seminoles were not in sync the way they were in big wins against LSU and Southern Miss. Norvell knows that simply cannot happen Saturday against Clemson, in a game that could go a long way toward determining who makes it to the ACC championship game.

Though the Tigers go into this game unranked in the AP poll, they remain the defending ACC champions and have not lost to Florida State at home since 2013. Norvell said he has addressed the shortcomings in the BC game with his team -- starting with what happened once the Seminoles came back to take a 31-10 lead with 11:20 to go in the third quarter. From that point on, Florida State had its only five penalties of the game, and two turnovers, ultimately allowing the Eagles to climb back into it before coming up just short, 31-29.

""There was still a quarter and a half left to go in the game, and that's the edge I'm talking about,"" Norvell said. ""I told the team after the game, that's where the killer instinct has to set up. Like, this is done. I'm going to finish better than what it was, pissed off at the fact that we started off not as good as we needed to. And we didn't have that.""

Norvell also pointed out three major coverage busts on defensive alignments they have practiced ""190-plus times"" since fall camp started. The defense could not contain BC quarterback Thomas Castellanos, either, as he threw for 305 yards and ran for another 95.

""That game didn't need to be what it was, but maybe it was just the thing that we needed to show the importance of every snap and every rep and every opportunity,"" Norvell said. ""So I think our guys, they got the message, and now we have to go do something about it."" -- Andrea Adelson

Alabama: For the first time since the 2015 season, Alabama enters a game ranked outside the AP's top 10. The Crimson Tide have looked like anything but a College Football Playoff contender the last two weeks with an ugly 17-3 win at South Florida last week preceded by a double-digit loss at home against Texas. Jalen Milroe is back as Alabama's starting quarterback after not playing a week ago.

His first challenge will be not turning the ball over as Ole Miss and Lane Kiffin visit Bryant-Denny Stadium on Saturday. But to be fair, the Crimson Tide's problems run deeper than just their quarterback play after Tyler Buchner and Ty Simpson got their shot last week and were pedestrian at best.

As important as anything this week against Ole Miss will be Alabama's ability to run the ball and take the pressure off the quarterback. And when Milroe does pass, Alabama has to find a way to protect better. The Tide have allowed 12 sacks in three games. It should help getting starting guard Tyler Booker back in the lineup after he missed the South Florida game with back spasms. And on defense, Alabama has to prove it can slow down an explosive offense after Texas rolled up 454 total yards with Quinn Ewers passing for 349 yards and three touchdowns, and all the while, Alabama was unable to force any turnovers in that game. Ole Miss is ranked fourth nationally in scoring offense (52.7 points per game) and is ranked eighth nationally in yards per play (8.19).

First-year Ole Miss defensive coordinator Pete Golding knows the Alabama program as well as anyone. He was a member of Alabama's staff from 2018 to 2022, the last four seasons as defensive coordinator. Under Nick Saban, Alabama hasn't lost two games in September since his first season in 2007. But the last time the Tide lost their first SEC game of the season, 2015 to Ole Miss, they didn't lose again and captured the national championship. There doesn't appear to be that kind of talent on this particular team, but Saban's teams almost always get better as the season progresses. With the Lane Train in town, it's now or never if the Tide are going to make that kind of turnaround this season. -- Chris Low

Ohio State and Notre Dame: Ohio State and Notre Dame met in the 2022 season opener, the first regular-season game for former Buckeyes linebacker Marcus Freeman as Fighting Irish coach. Both teams have knocked off the rust entering Saturday's contest at Notre Dame Stadium, although neither has faced an opponent close to as talented as the other.

Buckeyes coach Ryan Day describes clashes where the talent gap is negligible as ""matchup games,"" and plenty should be revealed about both squads.

""I'm glad that we went through those three games to get to this point, with some of the new faces that we had,"" Day said. ""We did work out some of the issues, and so [I'm] excited to get on the field and go play this one. We have a pretty good idea of who our team is and where we're at, so now it's time to go play.""

Ohio State heads to South Bend feeling better about its offensive backfield, where quarterback Kyle McCord responded well last week after being named the starter, and running back TreVeyon Henderson is starting to recapture his 2021 form. But the Buckeyes still don't know how McCord will perform in a difficult road setting, or whether new starting tackles will protect him, or whether a talented defensive line can start making more impact plays.

Notre Dame knows a bit more about itself after four games, including a tricky Week 2 trip to NC State. Quarterback Sam Hartman has been excellent so far -- 13 touchdowns, 0 interceptions, 71.1 percent completion rate -- and the wide receiver group, a weakness for years, is showing promise with Jayden Thomas and Jaden Greathouse.

The Irish regain veteran defenders JD Bertrand and DJ Brown from injury, and have the cornerback talent with Benjamin Morrison and Cam Hart to cover Buckeyes star wideouts Marvin Harrison Jr. and Emeka Egbuka. Freeman, whose team limited Ohio State's offense last year but generated only 10 points of its own, is stressing complementary football this week.

""For our defense, what we want to do is make sure that we limit the big plays,"" he said. ""We want them to have to truly drive down the field. Offensively, we want to have success. We're not going to throw deep balls every play. We still want to win time-of-possession and those types of things that really factor into your success. But the mindset is different, because you know more about your team this year than you did last year for Game 1."" -- Adam Rittenberg

Utah: After winning the Pac-12 the past two seasons and the presumed return of the quarterback of both of those teams, Cameron Rising, Utah had the profile of a preseason top-10 team and listed among the Pac-12 favorites. And for the most part, those things remain true.

However, without Rising in the first three games of the season, the Utes offense hasn't exactly inspired confidence. The benefit of the doubt earned in claiming conference titles the past two seasons has started to erode. Without Rising, they were still good enough to grind out a win against a Florida team that last week beat then No. 11 Tennessee, but the longer he's out the worse Utah's odds of a three-peat become. He continues to practice, but his status for the game against UCLA on Saturday remains in question.

If Rising is back -- and playing at his customary high level -- Utah should feel good about already weathering the storm without him. If he's still out or doesn't look the same, things could go south quickly. -- Kyle Bonagura

Oklahoma State: The Cowboys lost eight starters when 18 players went into the transfer portal after last season. On Monday, Gundy talked about Deion Sanders' jolt at Colorado and how Gundy's philosophy will likely change moving forward.

""We're going to have to find ways to supplement it because history is telling us over the last couple of years that there's a percentage of your team that was going to go somewhere else,"" Gundy said. ""And if they do, we have to try to find other guys to come in here that are in the same maturity level and age group and then get them in the system and try to get them coached up.""

But in the meantime, there's still plenty of work to do this season -- especially after last week's stunning loss to South Alabama -- starting Saturday in Ames against Iowa State. -- Dave Wilson

Defenses to watch in Week 4

Syracuse ranks fourth nationally in scoring defense. Zach Bolinger/Icon Sportswire

ACC: There is one undefeated ACC team that not many people are talking about (yet) that will need to rely on its defense to win Saturday. That would be Syracuse. In three games, the Orange have played exceptionally well, ranking No. 4 in the nation in scoring defense (9 PPG), one of six FBS schools giving up fewer than 10 points a game this season. The 27 total points allowed in its first three games also is the lowest total allowed by the Orange since the 1983 season. Syracuse was tested a week ago against Purdue far more than its first two games, but will face its biggest challenge yet against Army on Saturday. The Black Knights are coming off an impressive win over UTSA last week and are averaging 235.7 yards per game on the ground. Plus, Syracuse cannot afford to look ahead. Clemson is on the schedule next week. -- Adelson

Big 12: Baylor and Texas are 2-2 in head-to-head matchups in the past four years, but Baylor has won both games in Waco, while losing both games in Austin. Recent history shows this might not be a pushover for the No. 3 Longhorns. Recent history also shows Baylor got off to a rough start, losing at home to Texas State, which has a dynamic offense, and losing late against Utah despite holding them in check all game. Texas has allowed 44 points, fewest through three games since 2010. So if Baylor, which has struggled to find a rhythm on offense this year, has a chance at another upset, the defense will have to deliver. Longhorns quarterback Quinn Ewers struggled last week against Wyoming, and Texas was able to lean on the running game late and pull away. Baylor currently is No. 105 in rushing defense, allowing 170 yards per game. -- Wilson

Big Ten: When training camp began, Ohio State's defensive linemen talked openly about becoming the nation's best. ""Overall, we've fixed all the screws that need to be tightened,"" defensive tackle Michael Hall Jr. told ESPN. So far, the defensive front hasn't delivered ""wow"" plays -- only three sacks from linemen, none from ends JT Tuimoloau and Jack Sawyer -- even though the unit ranks second nationally in points allowed (6.7 PPG). It's time for the ""Rushmen"" to rise against a gifted Notre Dame offensive front. -- Rittenberg

Colorado's offense has been prolific, but the Buffs haven't played a defense like Oregon's yet. Ali Gradischer/Getty Images

Pac-12: Colorado's offense has been prolific in three games with coordinator Sean Lewis calling the shots, but the Buffaloes haven't seen a defense nearly as talented or sophisticated as what they'll see at Oregon. The Ducks have the speed on the back end to keep up with the CU receivers and will make things difficult up front on a Colorado offensive line that has allowed the second-most sacks in the country (16) and failed to create any space for the running game. -- Bonagura

SEC: The only time Texas A&M has been tested on defense this season by a team with comparable talent, the Aggies gave up nearly 50 points in a disappointing 48-33 loss to Miami in Week 2. Granted, Auburn hasn't been an offensive juggernaut, but this is Texas A&M's SEC opener. The Tigers will again play two quarterbacks (Payton Thorne and Robby Ashford), and both are markedly different. Texas A&M's defensive roster is filled with former 4- and 5-star prospects, and the Aggies are too talented to play the way they did against the Hurricanes. They missed tackles and botched assignments. They seemed to clean up some of those miscues last week against UL Monroe. A better gauge of how much they've improved will come Saturday. -- Low

Notable quotes

Billy Napier: The Florida coach has tasted success, but he finally beat a nationally ranked team from the SEC last week when the Gators beat the Tennessee Volunteers 26-16.

""Success is a dirty process, and ultimately it's rewarding. You have to go through some ups and downs along the way.""

Kyle Whittingham: The Utah coach wouldn't speculate earlier this week on whether Cam Rising, the Utes' starting quarterback the past two seasons who has missed the first three weeks because of injury, would return for Saturday's game against UCLA.

""He practiced today, did a great job, but we will know nothing for 48 hours at the minimum. Then of course we won't make an announcement. You'll just find out on game day who the guy is. That's the best I can tell you right now."""

Ohtani was placed on the 10-day injured list. He has not played since Sept. 3 because of the oblique injury and his season as a pitcher ended on Aug. 23 because of a torn elbow ligament.

The two injuries ended one of the most remarkable seasons in major league history, two-way production that made him a favorite to win his second AL MVP award in three seasons and created speculation he might get a contract for $500 million or more as a free agent this offseason.

The 29-year-old set career bests with a .304 batting average and 1.066 OPS. He leads the AL with 44 homers and had 96 RBIs, eight triples and 20 stolen bases on an Angels team that entered Saturday at 68-80, on the verge of an eighth straight losing season.

Ohtani was 10-5 with a 3.14 ERA in 23 starts, striking out 167 and walking 55 in 132 innings. Ohtani and the Angels have not said whether he will need Tommy John surgery for the second time.

Ohtani had Tommy John surgery on Oct. 1, 2018, performed by Los Angeles Dodgers head team physician Neal ElAttrache. He returned to the Angels as a batter the following May 7 and to the mound on July 26, 2020, in a season delayed by the pandemic. He didn’t retire a batter in his return, got just five outs on Aug. 2 and left with a strained forearm that kept him from pitching until 2021.

Since then, he’s gone 34-16 with a 2.84 ERA in 74 starts.

Nearly all of the personal items had been removed from Ohtani’s locker and the adjoining empty stall after Friday night’s game. A fully packed bag with a logo from the 2023 All-Star Game sat in front of his stall where his shoes would normally be, and only a few workout shirts hung on the rack.

Nearly a half-hour after reporters were allowed into the locker room and noticed the absence of Ohtani’s possessions, an Angels spokesman said the team planned to give more information Saturday."

Miller’s manager confirmed the news to Variety in a statement on Sunday, which would’ve marked the actor’s 44th birthday.

“The actor was struggling with manic depression when he died,” the statement read.

Miller’s mother Patricia released a statement via her son’s manager, who posted the message on X (formerly known as Twitter). She began by thanking fans and friends for the “overwhelming amount of love, prayers [and] condolences sent to me and my family” following her son’s passing.

“He fought a long hard valiant battle with bipolar depression for years,” Patricia Miller’s statement read. “He did everything he could to control the disease.

CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- Monday night's NFC South battle between the Panthers and the Saints featured No. 1 overall draft pick Bryce Young at quarterback for Carolina and offseason addition Derek Carr under center for New Orleans, but each team's stout defense controlled the game.

The Saints finally scored the contest's first touchdown late in the third quarter then pulled away late to win 20-17. The Saints head into Week 3 at 2-0, while the Panthers fall to 0-2.

New Orleans Saints

Give the Saints' defense the MVP award for the second week in a row. The unit bailed out another shaky outing for the offense with a smothering performance against Young and the Panthers. The defense kept the rookie quarterback on his heels most of the night, holding him to 22 completions for 153 yards, thanks to a four-man rush that tallied four sacks. The Saints' offense struggled again, failing to score in the first half for the second straight week, but it was able to keep pace after a 42-yard pass to Chris Olave set up a touchdown in the third quarter.

Troubling trend: The offensive line play. There is certainly talent on an O-line stockpiled with first-round picks, but the unit hasn't been able to put things together this season. The Saints allowed Carr to be sacked four times, bringing the season total to eight through two games. Although New Orleans found more success in the run game than last week, running back Jamaal Williams left the game early with a hamstring issue.

QB breakdown: Carr didn't have an easy time of it early, throwing a bad interception and looking like his timing with his receivers was off. The Saints had to settle for field goals instead of getting in the end zone. But like last week, Carr was able to make the plays when it counted. The downfield throw to Olave was the first play of 20 yards by either team, and it seemed to make something click, as Carr followed that up with another key throw to Rashid Shaheed and a toss to Olave that set up the final touchdown.

Eye-popping stat: The Saints allowed 20 points or fewer for a franchise record 10th game in a row, dating back to last season, and it doesn't appear to be a fluke. The defense yielded fewer than 300 net yards for the second straight week, and it tallied four more sacks, bringing the season total to seven. The only blemish so far was a late touchdown by the Panthers with 1:16 left in the game; it was the first TD allowed by the Saints this season.

Next game: at Green Bay Packers (1 p.m. ET, Sunday)

Carolina Panthers

Young and the Panthers' offense were not ready for prime time on Monday night at Bank of America Stadium. The top pick of the draft turned in a dismal performance, though it wasn't all Young's fault. His offensive line broke down constantly, putting the former Alabama star under constant pressure against just a four-man rush. But when under pressure, Young didn't respond at all, until a fourth-quarter scramble for 26 yards. After going 2-for-10 passing and being sacked once against pressure in the opener, he was 3-for-8 for 13 yards with four sacks and a fumble in this one.

Young did a nice job of getting rid of the ball and making a few plays with his legs, but he still doesn't have a completion longer than 15 yards. All these are reasons Carolina has scored only two touchdowns in its first two tilts, and Young's inexperience continues to be front and center.

Troubling trend: Young and the Panthers on third down. The Panthers were 4-of-14 on third downs, and Young was a big reason for the inefficiency, going 4-for-9 for 32 yards with two sacks and two scrambles.

Biggest hole in the game plan: What to do on third-and-short. The Panthers can't use the quarterback sneak because Young (5-foot-10, 204 pounds) just isn't big enough to make that work. Plus, he doesn't have experience at it. So Carolina had to bring in backup quarterback Andy Dalton on those plays. The first time there was a false start. The second time Dalton pitched to running back Miles Sanders for a first down. But this could be an issue moving forward.

Pivotal play: On the first series of the second half, Young fumbled on a sack that would have put the Saints in the red zone with a 6-3 lead. It could have been disastrous, but the play was nullified, thanks to a defensive holding penalty. That allowed Carolina to stay within striking distance 'til the end.

Colorado two-way star Travis Hunter left Saturday night's 43-35, double-overtime victory over Colorado State after taking a hard sideline hit in the first half.

Coach Deion Sanders had no update after the game other than to say, the ""first thing I heard is he's going to be out a few weeks."" Hunter was taken to the hospital during the third quarter for an evaluation.

Sanders did not offer specifics about Hunter's injury.

""The bad thing about losing Travis,"" said defensive back Shilo Sanders, ""it's like you're losing two players at once.""

Hunter absorbed an illegal hit to his midsection in the second quarter on an incompletion at the Colorado sideline. Colorado State was whistled for two fouls on the play: Nickelback Ayden Hector was flagged for pass interference, and safety Henry Blackburn was assessed a foul for unsportsmanlike conduct after a late hit out of bounds.

Hunter, who earlier coughed up a fumble that was returned for a touchdown, returned to the game, playing on both offense and defense through the second quarter.

The Buffaloes trailed the Rams 21-14 when Hunter was transported to the hospital but rallied for their third straight win.

Along with Buffaloes quarterback Shedeur Sanders, Hunter has been mentioned as an early candidate for the Heisman Trophy after playing both cornerback and wide receiver.

Grinstead, who comprised 702 with vocalists Kameelah Williams and LeMisha Grinstead, died Saturday, 702's representative Cory Taylor confirmed to USA TODAY Sunday. A cause of death was not given.

Taylor shared a statement from Grinstead's bandmate and sister LeMisha, which was also posted on Instagram.

""It is with great sadness that I have to let you know that my beautiful sister and friend has passed away this evening,"" LeMisha said in the statement. ""She has had a long battle and she is finally at peace. That girl was as bright as the stars!""

LeMisha added: ""She was not only beautiful on the outside, but also within. Sharing the stage with her was a joy I will cherish for the rest of my life!""

Grinstead struggled with her health in the months leading up to her death. In December 2022, 702 shared on Instagram that Grinstead was taking ""a medical leave of absence due to serious medical issues."" The nature of Grinstead's medical issues was not disclosed in the post.

""It is our hope that she will have a healthy and speedy recovery in the months to come,"" the group wrote at the time. ""We ask that at this very difficult time that you please respect our privacy and continue to pray for us as Meelah and Misha continue to navigate and represent 702 for upcoming performances in 2023.""

Grinstead became a household name in music thanks to her membership in 702, whose name takes inspiration from the area code of the members' hometown Las Vegas. The group debuted in 1996 with the release of the gold-certified album ""No Doubt,"" which featured the hit single and Missy Elliott collaboration ""Steelo.""

702 went on to release two more albums, a self-titled sophomore album in 1999 and ""Star"" in 2003. The group's ""702"" album sold 1 million copies and boasted the No. 1 single ""Where My Girls At?""

Shilo Sanders admitted on Tuesday that he wanted to ""whoop"" Blackburn for the late hit.

DEION SANDERS SPEAKS OUT AGAINST REPORTED DEATH THREATS TOWARD COLORADO STATE SAFETY: 'THIS IS A GAME'

""Losing Travis is like losing two players because he plays offense and defense,"" Sanders told reporters.

Blackburn’s first-half hit had people up in arms, with Colorado State athletic director Joe Parker telling ESPN that the Rams senior safety had received death threats.

""We're very concerned about our player's safety, as Henry and his family have continued to receive these threats,"" Parker told ESPN. ""Henry never intended to put anyone in harm's way on the football field. It's not what we teach or coach. We hope that the irrational vitriol directed at Henry stops immediately.""

347,2023/09/17, 'cowboys game',https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401547415,"ARLINGTON, Texas -- — CeeDee Lamb went into the home opener for the Cowboys without new sidekick Brandin Cooks, who injured a knee in his Dallas debut a week earlier.

The team's No. 1 receiver didn't need a lot of help.

Lamb set up both of Dak Prescott's touchdown passes with big plays, Brandon Aubrey kicked five field goals in the 28-year-old rookie's home debut, and the Cowboys beat the New York Jets 30-10 on Sunday.

Zach Wilson threw three interceptions in his first start since Aaron Rodgers' season-ending Achilles tendon injury as the Cowboys (2-0) finished a season-opening sweep of the New York teams.

Dallas opened with a 40-0 rout of the NFC East rival Giants, while the Jets (1-1) were coming off an emotional overtime win over Buffalo after Rodgers was injured on the fourth snap of his New York debut.

“I like how we’ve done it in different ways, so that’s good,” Dallas owner/general manager Jerry Jones said. “I do feel very good about that. I think we’ve seen a lot of the fundamentals of our team, special teams, offense, defense, certain things that we’ve put in. We’re trying, we’re using them.”

Lamb was high on the list this time.

The fourth-year receiver tied a career high with 11 catches, including a 25-yarder over Tony Adams that set up tight end Jake Ferguson's 4-yard TD grab on the first possession after Dallas took the ball on the coin flip instead of deferring.

The next big one was a 20-yarder on a drive that answered Garrett Wilson's 68-yard touchdown catch, when Lamb hung on despite landing on a shoulder after getting upended by Adams, who injured a hamstring on the play and didn't return.

Rookie tight end Luke Schoonmaker's first career touchdown followed from the 1 after Brandin Echols was called for pass interference in the end zone.

Prescott targeted Lamb so much — 13 times, two shy of his career high — it was almost one too many. Sauce Gardner stepped in front of one of the throws and would have had a pick-6 to put the Jets in front before halftime but the ball slipped through his hands.

“I know what I’m capable of doing and the things I’m pretty good at it,” said Lamb, whose longest catch — a 31-yarder — set up the first field goal from Aubrey. “The show isn’t over. I’m still going week in and week out. I’m proving it to myself and proving it to my guy that I’m one of the best.”

Zach Wilson's long TD toss to Garrett Wilson got the Jets within three points in the second quarter, and the QB ran for 36 yards on a drive to a field goal for an eight-point halftime deficit.

But New York had just 147 yards outside the long TD, and four second-half turnovers left little doubt for Dallas, which had the ball for more than 42 minutes and ran 83 plays to 46 for the Jets.

“We saw almost 90 of them today, and you’re going to run of gas,” Jets coach Robert Saleh said. “We just didn’t give ourselves a chance defensively to get off the field and give our offense a chance to get any kind of rhythm going.”

Wilson, who was sacked three times a week after Dallas dropped the Giants' Daniel Jones seven times, was picked off by Jayron Kearse, Malik Hooker and Trevon Diggs.

Dalvin Cook lost a fumble when Micah Parsons, who had two sacks, ripped the ball out of his arms just before Cook was tackled. Parsons got up and ran to the end zone, but was ruled down on review.

“We’re off to an outstanding start,” coach Mike McCarthy said of a defense that has led the NFL in takeaways the past two seasons and was among the league leaders in sacks a year ago. “The pressure and the takeaways are at an incredible level after two games.”

Prescott was 31 of 38 for 255 yards and Tony Pollard had 72 yards rushing. Wilson finished 12 of 27 for 170 yards.

SETTLING IN

Aubrey had a 55-yarder among his five field goals and hasn't missed on 13 kicks since botching his first-ever NFL try on an extra point against the Giants. That miss was notable since Aubrey has the job in part because Brett Maher missed four consecutive PATs in a wild-card win at Tampa Bay last season. Aubrey has been unflappable since then.

SIDELINED COACH

Dallas defensive assistant Sharrif Floyd was taken off the field in the second half over medical concerns. He went down on the sideline and was attended to before going to the medical tent. From there, Floyd was escorted to the locker room.

INJURIES

Cowboys: LG Chuma Edoga, who has started in place of Tyler Smith in both games as Smith recovers from a hamstring injury, left in the second half with an elbow issue. He was replaced by undrafted rookie T.J. Bass. ... RG Zack Martin injured an ankle when Pollard ran into the back of him on a carry.

“Real Housewives of Orange County” cast member Shannon Beador was arrested for drunk driving and hit-and-run in Newport Beach, California over the weekend, according to police.

Beador, 59, was arrested and booked early Sunday, a public information officer for the Newport Beach Police Department told CNN. Alcohol-related DUI and a hit-and-run with property damage are both misdemeanor charges in Beador’s case, according to police.

She was released shortly after.

“I spent quite a bit of time with Shannon yesterday. She is extremely apologetic and remorseful. We will be awaiting the official information on this case as it becomes available, and Shannon is prepared to accept full responsibility for her actions,” Beador’s attorney Michael Fell told CNN in a statement on Monday.

Real estate agent and friend of Beador’s, Jeff Lewis, said on his Sirius XM radio show that he spoke with Beador following the incident, according to People.

“I will tell you she’s accepting full accountability,” Lewis said, adding that Beador was also “injured” in the car accident “so she’s going to be recovering.”

The Birds opened as 6.5-point favorites, but that's now dropped to around four or five points, depending on the sportsbook.

Here are two players I like to score on Monday Night Football:

A.J. Brown TD

In case you missed it, a conversation between wideout A.J. Brown and quarterback Jalen Hurts during last week's win over the Minnesota Vikings went viral.

Brown cleared the air about the conversation on Thursday, saying it was taken ""out of context"" and he and Hurts are on the same page.

Regardless, after the conversation aired on the broadcast, Hurts peppered his star wide receiver with targets. Brown would've had a touchdown against the Vikings if it didn't get nullified due to a hold by Rashaad Penny. Expect that trend to continue into Monday night.

RELATED: Eagles fans upset at Fanatics due to crooked Kelly Green merchandise

So far, DeVonta Smith has been Philly's best wideout, but Brown is due for a big game, which is why I like him to find the end zone for the first time this season at +145.

Odds: DraftKings Sportsbook.

Mike Evans TD

Surprisingly, the Bucs are 2-0 with Baker Mayfield leading the offense. He's completing 69.1% of his passes and tossed three touchdowns, including two that went to veteran wideout Mike Evans.

The Eagles are getting James Bradberry back from a concussion in Week 3, but Evans should still be able to score against a Philly defense that's allowed seven receiving touchdowns through two games.

The Bucs could line up Evans in the slot, where he's played on 42 snaps this season, second on the team behind fellow wideout Chris Godwin. The Eagles have been one of the worst defenses against slot receivers this year after starter Avonte Maddox got injured, according to The33rdTeam.

Maybe the Eagles put Bradberry in the slot against Evans, but he's been Mayfield's go-to target and I like him to score at +175.

PITTSBURGH -- Cleveland Browns wide receiver Amari Cooper kept shaking his head in disbelief. Quarterback Deshaun Watson couldn't find the words for several seconds. And defensive end Myles Garrett admitted, ""It f---ing hurts.""

Cleveland lost to the Pittsburgh Steelers 26-22 on ""Monday Night Football."" But in the Browns' locker room afterward, the loss of the game felt secondary compared to the loss of Nick Chubb.

The All-Pro running back suffered what coach Kevin Stefanski called a ""significant"" injury to his left knee in the second quarter and had to be carted off the field. Asked after the game if he anticipates Chubb missing the rest of the season, Stefanski told reporters: ""I do.""

Stefanski declined to specify Chubb's injury, but the team fears that Chubb suffered multiple tears in his knee, according to a source. A team official said Chubb was taken to a local hospital as a precaution and then returned to Cleveland ahead of the team.

""Obviously it's a huge loss,"" Cooper said. ""Nick is the engine of the team. Best player on the team. ... I'm very sad for Nick, sad for this team losing Nick. Not only is it not ideal, it's a tragedy.""

Chubb injured the knee following a 5-yard run to the Steelers' 3-yard line after Pittsburgh safety Minkah Fitzpatrick crashed into him while making a tackle. Players from both teams gathered around Chubb as he was loaded on the cart.

The injured left knee is the same one Chubb had reconstructed after tearing his MCL, PCL and LCL while at Georgia in 2015.

""At that moment, it was tough,"" said Watson, Chubb's longtime friend. ""Once we saw the [stadium] replay, [I had] a lot of flashbacks to the [injury] he had in college.""

Before leaving the game, Chubb had already totaled 64 rushing yards on 10 carries. He had rushed for more than 1,000 yards in four straight seasons, including a career-high 1,525 yards last year.

According to ESPN Stats & Information research, Chubb is one of just five players in NFL history with at least eight rushing touchdowns in each of his first five seasons, alongside Adrian Peterson, LaDainian Tomlinson, Emmitt Smith and former Browns great Jim Brown.

""He totes the rock, every play he gets the ball,"" Cleveland defensive end Za'Darius Smith said of Chubb. ""That piece is [now] missing.""

Without Chubb, the Browns' offense struggled the rest of the game. His replacement, Jerome Ford, reeled off a 69-yard run to set up a go-ahead touchdown in the third quarter. But Cleveland never scored again. And Pittsburgh's second defensive touchdown of the night proved to be the game-winning score.

Browns All-Pro guard Joel Bitonio admitted the offense missed its star rusher in the second half.

""He's a great teammate, he works hard, a great person,"" Bitonio said. ""To see him go down ... it's tough. ... It's a big loss.""

Going into Monday, the Browns were trying to start 2-0 for the first time since 1993. Instead, they'll have to move forward without one of the top running backs in the league.

""That's our brother, my brother,"" Garrett said. ""Been together a long time. It's a blow for the whole team. We don't want his injury to be in vain. We gotta push on. That's what he would want us to do. Just continue to fight."""

The fifth “Vault” track (that was not previously shared by Google) is titled “Slut!”

No additional features are listed on the tracklist.

PREVIOUSLY: After employing Google to have Swifties solve puzzles in order to reveal the “Vault” tracks on her “1989 (Taylor’s Version)” album, Taylor Swift has finally shared the titles of the bonus tracks that will appear on her re-recorded album.

“1989 (Taylor’s Version)” will be released in October with the surprise tracks: “Is It Over Now?,” “Say Don’t Go,” “Now That We Don’t Talk” and “Suburban Legends.” Swift also promised a fifth, as of now unnamed song, will appear on her album as well as a Target-exclusive track that has not yet been announced.

Google announced the collaboration with the globally lauded pop singer on Tuesday. The puzzles are still visible if you Google “Taylor Swift” and click on the blue vault to solve one of the word puzzles.

“It may take a second, since there are 89 puzzles to get through (a la “1989 (Taylor’s Version)”) — don’t say we didn’t warn ya! But nothing lasts forever,” the search engine wrote on their official blog post. “You’ll be helping Swifties around the world get out of the woods (or unlock the vault) as everyone collectively solves 33 million puzzles. And that’s how it works, that’s how you get the vault track titles!”

Naturally, much like Swift’s massive arena-sized Era’s Tours, the ordeal caused a few traffic jams on the way, leading Google to tweet: “Swifties, the vault is jammed! But don’t worry, there are no blank spaces inside. We’re in our fix-it era and will be out of the woods soon.”

The problem was solved not much later and Google officially unveiled four titles on social media on Wednesday morning. A clip of Swift reading out the titles can now be heard before the puzzle opens.

BEREA, Ohio -- The Cleveland Browns are bringing back Kareem Hunt to help patch up their backfield in the wake of the season-ending injury to All-Pro Nick Chubb.

Terms were not disclosed but a source told ESPN's Adam Schefter on Wednesday that Hunt signed a one-year deal worth up to $4 million. Chubb was placed on injured reserve in a corresponding move.

""I came ready to play and win. I'm just ready to go out there and showcase my talent,"" Hunt said Wednesday. ""I know what I bring to the table. ... I'm willing to come in and do whatever it takes just to help win.""

Hunt and Chubb played the previous four seasons together, forming one of the NFL's most potent running back duos.

Now, Hunt will team up with second year running back Jerome Ford, who replaced Hunt as Chubb's backup to begin this season.

Hunt's familiarity with the Browns' offense played a key role in Cleveland targeting him, although Ford is expected to be the team's lead back going forward.

Hunt rushed for 1,874 yards from 2019 to 2022 with the Browns. He averaged 4.2 yards per carry and scored 16 rushing touchdowns. He also caught 132 passes for 973 yards and seven more scores.

The Cleveland-area native asked for a trade last year after the Browns declined to extend his contract. Cleveland, however, couldn't make a deal before the trade deadline and Hunt finished the season with the team. Since March, Hunt had visits with multiple teams, including the New Orleans Saints and Indianapolis Colts, but remained a free agent.

Chubb injured his left knee in the second quarter of Monday night's loss to the Pittsburgh Steelers. He had to be carted off the field. Browns coach Kevin Stefanski confirmed this week that Chubb's injury would require surgery.

""You don't replace Nick Chubb,"" Stefanski said. ""You just don't do that. Great players in the league, you look around, they go out. It's always not one person that replaces a player of [Chubb's] caliber. So, everybody's got to do a little bit more, a little bit more everywhere.""

Steelers running back Najee Harris was close to Chubb when he was loaded into the cart on Monday night and called the injury ""scary.""

""That could happen any play to me. So, just around the league, though, a lot of backs have been getting hurt. For Nick alone, he's a great guy. I talked to him plenty of times. I'm going to reach out to him again, actually. But just prayers up for Nick. I was hurt when I saw it. That's why I ran over there, and I just felt bad for him. So, prayers up for him,"" Harris said.

356,2023/09/19, 'champions league',https://www.theguardian.com/football/live/2023/sep/20/bayern-munich-v-manchester-united-champions-league-live-updates,"20 Sept 2023 17.32 EDT Erik ten Hag: “I am disappointed because we should stay in the game,” says Manchester United’s manager. “When you score three goals at Bayern you should at least take a point. We are in a period where a lot is going against us but we have to make our own luck.” On Andre Onana: “It’s good he's doing that [acknowledging his mistake] but always when mistakes are being made you have to bounce back as a team. When you score three goals, when one player makes a mistake, it’s gone. We as a team always have to believe we can bounce back.”



20 Sept 2023 17.21 EDT Andre Onana: “It’s difficult to lose this way,” says Manchester United’s goalkeeper. “After my mistake, we lost control of the game. It’s a difficult situation for us, especially for me because I’m the one who let the team down. “The team were very good but we didn’t win this game. We have to move forward because this is the life of a footballer. I have to recognise that because of me we didn’t win. I have a lot to prove.”



20 Sept 2023 17.13 EDT Harry Kane: “It was a crazy finish but I think for the majority of the game we controlled it,” says the Bayern Munich striker in an interview with TNT Sports. “We dictated the tempo, obviously went 3-1 ahead and then we just lost a bit of concentration in the last five minutes. Thankfully we were able to hold on to the lead but overall it was a really good start to the campaign against a very good side in Man United.” On his goal: “It’s been nice,” he says. “It’s always good to score but there’s always room for improvement. It was a really good night tonight, we’ve started the season well and now we have another quick turnaround before another home game here at the weekend.”



20 Sept 2023 17.09 EDT Andre Onana: United’s Cameroonian goalkeeper will kop a lot of flak for the mistake which led to Bayern Munich’s opener after Manchester United had played quite well for the opening 25 minutes, but it was worth remembering that United’s goalekeper made several good saves to leave his side in with a chance of salvaging an unlikely point in the closing minutes of this massively entertaining and at times chaotic game. There is a lot of blame to go around at Old Trafford for Manchester United’s current woes and not much of it should be levelled at their goalkeeper.



20 Sept 2023 16.59 EDT A quick recap: United started well and almost took the lead in the fourth minute, only to concede a quick-fire first-half double to Leroy Sane and Serge Gnabry. Sent out early for the second half, United pulled a goal back through Rasmus Hojlund, only for Harry Kane to add Bayern’s third from the penalty spot five minutes later. Coming either side of Mathys Tel’s fine strike, Casemiro’s late brace was not enough to rescue anything for United, who have now lost three games in a row, conceding 10 goals in the process.



20 Sept 2023 16.56 EDT Full time: Bayern Munich 4-3 Manchester United Peep! Peep! Peeeeeeeeeeeeeep! It’s all over at the Allianz Arena, where Bayern Munich have won by the odd goal in seven, even if the scoreline doesn’t do justice to their almost total dominance throughout the game. Let the latest Manchester United post mortem begin …



20 Sept 2023 16.54 EDT GOAL! Bayern Munich 4-3 Man Utd (Casemiro 90+4) 90+4 min: Manchester United win a free-kick wide on the left, just outside the Bayern Munich penalty area.

20 Sept 2023 16.51 EDT GOAL! Bayern Munich 4-2 Manchester United (Tel 90+2) Bayern wrap things up! Just on as a substitute, Mathys Tel cushions a pass from Joshua Kimmich on his thigh and then rifles the ball into the roof of the net from six or seven yards out. Moments before the 18-year-old scored, his fellow sub Thomas Muller had hit the post. The duo came on for Harry Kane and Leroy Sane.

Updated at 16.51 EDT

20 Sept 2023 16.45 EDT 86 min: It’s men against boys at the Allianz Arena and one suspects that only compacency could cost Bayern at this late stage. United have conceded three goal for the third consecutive game, a defensive porousness their players and supporters are not accustomed to.



20 Sept 2023 16.42 EDT 84 min: Rashford gets a cross into the Bayern Munich penalty area, trying to pick out Garnacho at the far post. The ball bounces a little too high for the substitute and he’s unable to steer a shot goalwards.



20 Sept 2023 16.41 EDT 83 min: Bayern goalkeeper Sven Ulreich pings a clearance to Laimer out by the right touchline and Bayern Munich set off upfield again. The ball finds its way to the feet of Choupo-Moting, whose dipping shot from distance is saved by Onana.

Updated at 17.38 EDT

20 Sept 2023 16.38 EDT 80 min: Leroy Sane plays a weighted pass into the path of Kingsley Coman, who unleashes a fierce drive from a tight-ish angle. Onana saves at his near post.



20 Sept 2023 16.36 EDT 78 min: Onana flings himself to his right with both arms outstretched to save a Choupo-Moting shot from distance. Good goalkeeping.



20 Sept 2023 16.35 EDT 76 min: Diogo Dalot slides in with a well-timed tackle to prevent Choupo-Moting pulling the trigger after being teed up just inside the United penalty area.



20 Sept 2023 16.31 EDT 73 min: Standing out near the left touchline, Bruno Fernandes shapes to receive a sideways pass from one of his central defenders, lets the ball roll over his foot and watches in dismay as it goes out for a throw-in. It’s been that kind of night.

Updated at 17.37 EDT

20 Sept 2023 16.30 EDT 70 min: Bayern Munich enjoy a long spell of keep-ball, leaving United’s players to chase shadows. They eventually win back possession and Reguilon, who has been one of United’s better players this evening (it’s a low bar), sets off on another rampage of sorts up the left flank. He runs into traffic and his efforts come to nothing.



20 Sept 2023 16.25 EDT 67 min: The stand-out player on the pitch tonight, Jamal Musiala, who is only 20, gallops upfield again and picks out Kingsley Coman wide on the right. He tries to find Goretska with a cross into the United penalty area but the ball is cleared.



20 Sept 2023 16.22 EDT 64 min: A viciously dipping drive from Leroy Sane almost catches out Onana but the United goalkeeper manages to parry the ball away from danger and out for a corner. He punches the subsequent inswinger clear.



20 Sept 2023 16.20 EDT 62 min: Bayern advance upfield at speed with Musiala on the ball. He plays it wide to Harry Kane, who stings the palms of Onana with a rising drive towards the near post.



20 Sept 2023 16.19 EDT 58 min: Quite apart from being extremely harsh on Christian Eriksen, the penalty awarded to Bayern Munich took a while coming. Initially, it looked like both the ref and his VAR officials had decided not to give it, then Glenn Nyberg was told to adjourn to his pitchside monitor to have a look at some replays. Despite Eriksen’s very close proximity to Upamecano (not Goretska, as I previously said) and despite his arm not being in a particularly “unnatural” position, he was deemed to have handled the ball and the spot-kick was awarded.



20 Sept 2023 16.15 EDT 57 min: Leroy Sane smacks a low diagonal shot off the foot of the far post after excellent work by Musiala, who is causing Manchester United’s defence all sorts of problems and played a weighted ball into his teammates path on this occasion.

Updated at 16.26 EDT

20 Sept 2023 16.13 EDT 55 min: Going back to that United goal, Hojlund opened his United account with a low shot that was teed up by Marcus Rashford and took a big deflection on its way past Sven Ulreich.

Updated at 17.03 EDT

20 Sept 2023 16.10 EDT Penalty for Bayern Munich! That is very, very harsh. Eriksen was standing so close to Goretska there was nothing he could do to stop the ball hitting his arm.



20 Sept 2023 16.10 EDT 51 min: Bayern go close with a shot on goal blocked by Diogo Dalot, before Leon Goretska has a header hit the outstretched arm of Christian Eriksen in the Manchester United penalty area. The ref is going to his pitchside monitor to have a look.



20 Sept 2023 16.08 EDT GOAL! Bayern Munich 2-1 Manchester United (Hojlund 48) United pull a goal back. It’s not pretty, but Rasmus Hojlund’s deflected shot from 12 yards marks his first goal for Manchester United and gets them back into the game.

Updated at 16.13 EDT

20 Sept 2023 16.06 EDT 48 min: Casemiro plays a quick ball forward for Fernandes to chase through the right side of the Bayern penalty area. A Manchester United target dsuring the summer, Kim Min-Jae gets across to head the ball out of his path.



20 Sept 2023 16.05 EDT 47 min: Rasmus Hojlund wins a throw-in deep in Bayern Munich territory, down by the corner flag. It’s taken, United lose possession and Bayern win a throw-in in much the same place.



20 Sept 2023 16.04 EDT Second half: Bayern Munich 2-0 Manchester United 46 min: Play resumes, with Manchester United having been sent out for the second half about five minutes before their hosts. There are no changes in personnel on either side.



20 Sept 2023 16.01 EDT An email: “Why the dig at Harry Maguire in the 41st minute?” asks Jason. “I thought he was injured and unavailable tonight?” I was actually referring to the man named Harry who is on the pitch, not the one who isn’t. Mr Kane has an assist to his name, having teed up Leroy Sane for Bayern’s opener, but I’m fairly confident it is written in the gods that he will get on the score-sheet.



20 Sept 2023 15.50 EDT Half-time: Bayern Munich 2-0 Manchester United Peep! Referee Glenn Nyberg draws the first half to a close, with Manchester United trailing 2-0 despite getting off to a good start. A howler from Andre Onana gifted Bayern an opener scored by Leroy Sane, while some brilliant build-up play from Jamal Musiala led to their second from Serge Gnabry. United have a mountain to climb if they are to avoid losing their third game in a row.



20 Sept 2023 15.47 EDT 45 min: Goretska picks out Sane in acres of space on the right flank with a pass from midfield. He cuts inside on his left foot and sends a curled effort narrowly wide of Onana’s far post. Close, but no cigar on this occasion.



20 Sept 2023 15.46 EDT 43 min: Bayern Munich continue to turn the screw, piling the pressure on United. Bruno Fernandes gives his side some much-needed respite, intercepting a Leon Goretska pass and playing the ball upfield.



20 Sept 2023 15.44 EDT 42 min: Marcus Rashford chases a long ball towards the byline but Dayot Upamecano is able to match him for speed and shepherd the ball out of play for a goal-kick. Rashford shakes his head in frustration.



20 Sept 2023 15.43 EDT 41 min: Having started so well, Manchester United find themselves two quick-fire goals down as we approach half-toime. Gnabry tries to play Musiala through on goal but his pass is intercepted. United are on the ropes and Harry hasn’t even scored yet.



20 Sept 2023 15.40 EDT 37 min: Rasmus Hojlund gets a half chance, leaping to get on the end of a Diogo Dalot cross from the left. The delivery is a little to high for him and he’s unable to steer his header on goal.

Updated at 15.54 EDT

20 Sept 2023 15.38 EDT 35 min: Manchester United win a free-kick wide on the right and Lindelof and Martinez make their way into the Bayern penalty area. They shouldn’t have bothered, as Fernandes’ delivery sails over the heads of both men and is cleared by the head of Upamecano.



20 Sept 2023 15.35 EDT GOAL! Bayern Munich 2-0 Manchester United (Gnabry 31) Oof! Brilliant play from Jamal Musiala, who accelerates down the inside-left, taking on and beating Diogo Dalot, before turning to tee up Serge Gnabry with a pull-back. Bayern’s No7 made no mistake, spanking the ball past Onana, who couldn’t do much about that one. Serge Gnabry smacks home Bayern’s second. Photograph: Alex Grimm/Getty Images

J.J. Watt retired with 114.5 sacks, which should be good enough to get him an entry to the Pro Football Hall of Fame.

But will he end up as the all-time sack leader in his family?

T.J. Watt is coming for the title. The Pittsburgh Steelers outside linebacker reached a milestone Monday night with a sack of the Cleveland Browns' Deshaun Watson in the second quarter.

That was sack No. 81.5 of Watt's career, which is the new all-time Steelers record. Even though sacks didn't become an official stat until 1982 and many great Steelers defenders played before then, Pittsburgh has had a lot of great defenders since 1982 as well. And Watt has topped them all. Watt passed James Harrison for the record, two games into his seventh season with the team.

T.J. Watt is now the #Steelers All-Time sacks leader with 81.5‼️ pic.twitter.com/qoXWayGtWX — Pittsburgh Steelers (@steelers) September 19, 2023

J.J. Watt was watching and, as expected, pumped up his brother's accomplishments.

TJ WATT is the best defensive player on the planet.



Stop trying to question it, stop trying to justify anyone else.



He is the best.

Period. — JJ Watt (@JJWatt) September 19, 2023

Watt had another highlight later on. He scored the first defensive touchdown of his career, after Alex Highsmith sacked Deshaun Watson, knocking the ball loose. Watt scooped it up and returned it 17 yards for a score.

T.J. Watt is 28 years old. It seems reasonable that he can get the 33 sacks he needs to catch his brother. T.J. has an NFL Defensive Player of the Year award and a tie for the all-time single-season sack record with Michael Strahan.

If T.J. keeps up this pace for a few more years, he should pass his brother. And both seem likely to reunite in Canton."

LAKE FOREST, Ill. -- Alan Williams has resigned as the Chicago Bears' defensive coordinator, the team announced Wednesday.

""I am taking a step back to take care of my health and family. I appreciate the opportunity to work with the Chicago Bears, a storied NFL franchise with a rich history,"" Williams said in a statement.

""I value the NFL shield and all that it stands for and after taking some time to address my health, I plan to come back and coach again,"" he added.

Williams, 53, has been away from the Bears since last week with what the team classified as a personal reason. Details around Williams' absence had been vague, including a one-sentence statement from the team Wednesday confirming his resignation.

Both the Bears and Williams' lawyer said a report in Chicago of police activity at the team facility was inaccurate.

""He has tremendous respect for the Bears organization and he just thought it was the time to handle this health issue and his personal matters,"" Andrew M. Stroth, a sports attorney based in Chicago who is Williams' personal attorney, told ESPN.

Bears coach Matt Eberflus took over defensive playcalling duties Sunday against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and said earlier Wednesday that he would continue to call the defense this Sunday against the Kansas City Chiefs if there was no resolution with Williams.

Asked whether not having a defensive coordinator could become problematic for the 0-2 Bears, Eberflus said he did not think that would be an issue due to the experience of his defensive staff.

""We have [safeties coach] Andre Curtis, [cornerbacks coach/passing game coordinator] Jon Hoke, all those guys that have great experience,"" Eberflus said. ""Guys that have been in our system. [Linebackers coach Dave] Borgonzi, [assistant defensive backs coach David] Overstreet, all those guys are working diligently, so we're prepared and ready to go.""

The Bears hired Williams in February 2022, shortly after Eberflus got the head-coaching job. Williams spent four seasons as the Indianapolis Colts' safeties coach while Eberflus was the team's defensive coordinator. It was his second stint with Indianapolis after coaching defensive backs there for 10 seasons from 2002 to 2011.

Williams was the Minnesota Vikings' defensive coordinator in 2012 and 2013. He has more than three decades of coaching experience.

360,2023/09/20, 'pop record',https://www.billboard.com/culture/pride/kim-petras-surprise-release-new-album-problematique-1235414763/,"Surprendre, Bunheads! Pop superstar Kim Petras is here to say “bonjour” to her fans with a special surprise project.

On Monday (Sept. 18), Petras is set to surprise drop her French-pop album Problématique via Repbulic / Amigo Records. Across 10 tracks, Petras delves into ecstatic pop sounds, ranging from funk (“Born Again”), to R&B-pop (“Deeper”) to bratty, materialistic pop jams (“All She Wants” featuring Paris Hilton). As she sings on the titular track, “I’m a little bit dramatic, little real, a little plastic/ I just keep on wreaking havoc.”

Some fans have already heard the tracks off of Problematique, thanks to a major leak of the album back in early August 2022. While most singers would encourage fans not to listen to pirated songs, Petras took a very different approach on X (formerly known as Twitter). Writing candidly in a series of since-deleted tweets, Petras told fans that they may as well give the album a listen, since it was unlikely they would get to hear it otherwise.

“It’s ok if u wanna listen to the leaks … I’m not getting to put out any music anyways I’m f—ed. I’m devastated idk how all of this happened and I just wanna quit,” she wrote at the time. “Nothing is scrapped I didn’t get approval to release anything. It’s limbo.” A press release for the album confirms that Problématique was originally shelved “after partially leaking and leaving fans clamoring for more.”

The new album is Petras’ second of 2023 — in June, she unveiled Feed the Beast, her long-awaited Republic debut. Her latest album drop comes just a week before Petras is set to head on her headlining world tour in support of Feed the Beast, kicking off the 34-date run in Austin, TX on September 27. Tickets are available at Petras’ website.

Nacho said Jude Bellingham ""was born to play for Real Madrid"" after the midfielder's sixth goal in six games gave the LaLiga giants a 1-0 Champions League win over Union Berlin in their opening game in Group C.

Bellingham pounced on a loose ball in the six-yard box in the 94th minute on Wednesday night at the Santiago Bernabeu -- after Federico Valverde's shot was deflected -- to rob the Bundesliga side of a point on their competition debut.

The England international has found the net in five of his six Real Madrid appearances so far, only drawing a blank in Sunday's 2-1 league win over Real Sociedad.

""I think Jude was born to play for Real Madrid,"" club captain Nacho told Movistar. ""We're lucky to have him here with us. Let's hope he keeps scoring goals.""

Bellingham's strike against Union Berlin was the second time he's won a game for Madrid in added time at the Bernabeu, after his 95th minute winner against Getafe on Sept. 2.

""We were patient,"" Bellingham told Movistar. ""We knew we'd get chances at the end of the game. We had to move the ball, find spaces. We kept going, we showed a great mentality, great togetherness.""

Bellingham scored 14 goals for Borussia Dortmund in all of last season, and already has six this campaign.

""Around the pitch I want to be an artist, I want to try to create stuff for my teammates, but when the ball goes into the box I want to be a killer,"" he said. ""That's what's going to win us games. Hopefully it continues.""

Coach Carlo Ancelotti has picked Bellingham in a more advanced, No. 10 role to maximise his goalscoring.

""Bellingham has quality, that's very important, and he has luck,"" Ancelotti said in his post-match news conference. ""This goal was similar to the one against Getafe. He always arrives at the right time. He's smarter than the rest."""

363,2023/09/20, 'nice to meet you',https://www.stirworld.com/see-features-mini-imagines-a-vibrant-new-world-at-the-london-design-festival-2023,"Tall leafy plants, simple shingle roofs, and the new electric car of the future. A simple, utopian world reminiscent of Minecraft's pixelated aesthetics. Simple shapes and bold colours populate the space of Shoreditch Electric Light Station as part of a spatial installation at this year's London Design Festival, created by MINI in collaboration with artist and designer Morag Myerscough. MINI is the automotive partner for this year's design festival and along with this installation—conceived to announce their new MINI Cooper Electric—has organised talks and events throughout the week, to explore the future of urban design and technology.

Other initiatives by MINI at LDF 2023 include The Urban Cabin, a research space designed in collaboration with architect Sam Jacob, a part of MINI LIVING, a long-term research project that explores the future of urban habitats; and Forests, an installation in the square next to Shoreditch Fire Station in east London, UK created in collaboration with architect Asif Khan, which uses plants to explore the relationship between private and public spaces within the city.

Described as 'a luscious urban world where tradition meets technology,' the installation at Shoreditch Electric represents the meeting of MINI and Myerscough’s shared values of innovation and the creative use of space. Myerscough, who grew up in the grim environment of Holloway, describes her vision as ""aspirational, magical and a possible future for the city."" ""There are shared streets, shared cars, clutter removed and offering a positive future within a renewable context. I want people to feel uplifted by these possibilities. The plants are as big as the houses,"" she shares. Myerscough’s signature style presents a vividly immersive experience, a journey into a future where the grass is greener, and the future is electric. The juxtaposition of situating it in a 19th century electricity generating station adds a whole new dimension to the space at the design event taking place from September 16-24, 2023.

A sense of nostalgia permeates the immersive installation. From the title Nice to Meet you Again, which pays homage to the Classic Mini make seen in their newly launched vehicle, to Myerscough’s rural-inspired utopia. Offering an insight into the future envisioned by MINI, the utopian here is in reference to a place where the bucolic meets the urban. It represents hope, rendered so exuberantly in Myerscough's signature colours. For her design, Myerscough was inspired by the notion of a metropolis that is made by the people. In this vein, Nice to Meet You Again incorporates the vibrancy of cityscapes with the sensorial experience of the country.

Myerscough was perhaps the perfect contemporary artist to collaborate on this undertaking. She explains, “It’s as if MINI took colours from my palette and put it in their range.” Pinks, yellows and purples are layered atop the trademark greens, browns and blues of the brand’s cars, each playing off the other. Moreover, her ability to inject joy into urban and indoor spaces, and foreground a sense of belonging in the communities she works with comes through in emphasising the brand’s values. MINI’s initiatives at this year’s festival underscore their commitment to creating positive change within urbanscapes.

As the brand moves to be fully electric by 2030, visitors to the installation are invited into a possible future world that reflects a sense of optimism and MINI’s signature playful nature. Talking about the sensorial experience of her design, and how the lockdown served as inspiration, Myerscough relays, “(when lockdown hit) birds started singing and I thought, ‘Wow—this is what it would be like if we don’t have big lorries coming into the city.” Seasonal smells, pleasant chirps and a sense of countryside camaraderie fill the air at Shoreditch Electric Station. At least for a while. The installation is on view from September 16-19.

364,2023/09/20, 'angelica ross',https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/angelica-ross-interview-ryan-murphy-emma-roberts-american-horror-story-1235596354/,"Angelica Ross never needed Hollywood.

Long before she got famous on Pose — burning up the screen playing ballroom diva Candy Ferocity, who stole season three by starring in an episode set at her own funeral — she was already an accomplished activist and self-taught computer coder who founded TransTech Summit, which helps trans people find careers in tech. But Ross’ natural talents for acting took her far in Hollywood: After Pose, she transitioned to another Ryan Murphy production at FX, American Horror Story, where she held her own among vets like Emma Roberts and Billie Lourd in the slasher-themed 1984 season of the anthology series. But all was not copacetic, as Ross revealed this week in a flurry of X (formerly known as Twitter) posts and Instagram Live broadcasts.

Providing screengrabs of emails and detailed accounts of conversations, Ross, 42, says Murphy abruptly stopped communicating with her three years ago, during which no one in his company, Ryan Murphy Productions, would offer her any information about her status within the AHS franchise. Roberts, meanwhile, could be a bullying presence on set, Ross alleges, once going so far as to misgender her in front of a director. The revelations come ahead of an announcement that Ross is packing up her home in downtown Los Angeles and moving back to her house in Georgia full-time, where she will transition to a career in politics — just one of the things she reveals to The Hollywood Reporter first in this exclusive interview.

I saw your tweet, so why don’t we start there? What do you mean when you say you’re “leaving Hollywood?”

It’s sort of a “Fool me once, shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me” situation. I thought that Ryan Murphy was going to be my champion. I thought he understood. He tweeted something about me after season three of Pose: “I really appreciate Angelica for her strength and her bluntness, but also her talent.”

All the people who are part of all of this know exactly what I’m talking about. They know how I showed up on set. They know that I was moving in my Buddha nature. My hairstylist would even say, “Angel, I can feel the peace radiating off of you.” There would be so much chaos going on because on a Ryan Murphy set, there is sure to be chaos. That’s just something that people know from Glee. We’ve heard about that on American Horror Story, Scream Queens and so on.

But Murphy did seem to champion you. He put you in Pose. He brought you to American Horror Story.

Going over to American Horror Story, the truth is I rejected their offer. I knew that by killing me off on Pose and then trying to usher me over to American Horror Story: 1984, that [Murphy] was trying to paint a narrative that he is supportive [of championing diversity].

But when they came to me with a salary of $28,000 an episode, I was a little offended. I was just like, “No, I need more money.” I asked them for $50,000 an episode, and they told me they couldn’t do that. So I said, “I appreciate your time, but tell Ryan Murphy, thank you.” I was willing to walk away from the situation because in truth, I’m a scaredy-cat. I’m really not great with horror. But they did come back and did give me more money. It wasn’t $50,000 an episode, but it was a significant bump. And then I went on to do those seasons.

And was it as chaotic behind the scenes as Pose?

What I witnessed — my eyes just bucked open. I just wasn’t sure what I was witnessing. I definitely was witnessing a lot of white men on set in kind of a white-male-dominated space. But somehow folks like Emma Roberts and others — I mean even Billie Lourd, but Billie Lourd I’m cool with — those girls were able to make moves on the set. They were able to open up their mouths and things moved. Sometimes I didn’t know if I was watching a mean girl or if I was just watching a woman standing up for herself.

At one point, I see Emma talking to the director, John, about something that he wants to do. He’s trying to get Emma to do something, and she’s not complying. And she says to him, “What are you going to do about it, John? You’re going to cry about it? Waaah. John’s not getting his way.” I was like, “Well, damn, she’s been in the business for so long, she probably knows what she’s talking about.” You know, Emma was aware of the T-shirts.

What T-shirts?

There was a crewmember who was operating my vehicle that I had to drive on camera, so he’s right outside my windshield and every day he was wearing a racist T-shirt.

Like?

One day it was, “BUILD THAT WALL.” The next day it was white praying hands in front of an American flag, and it said, “I DON’T KNEEL.” Those are the ones I remember. This guy had a collection. I started speaking up about it.

Where is Ryan Murphy in all this? Is he there every day?

No, he’s not around. Ryan’s not usually there for American Horror Story.

OK, so who’s the boss?

Well … Whoever is number one on the call sheet.

So Emma Roberts?

Yeah. From what I saw on set and how she talked to the directors and everyone else, my view would be Emma was the boss. She had her trailer outside of the sound studio, not where all the other trailers were. She made sure that everything went through her. She would literally tell them what order we were filming scenes.

You tweeted that Emma Roberts called you to apologize for her behavior on set. How did that go?

It was a bumpy conversation. She apologized and she said, “I hate that you walked away from our experience together feeling like that. I see in hindsight what I did and how stupid that was. I’m an ally.” I was like, “No, you’re not. You can’t call yourself an ally. [Allyship] is an action. You need to be real with me in this conversation. I’m being real with you. You were being messy.” She said, “I hope that we can go move forward and fix this. I see you out there doing such great work out there.”

And I said, “Oh, so you see me? You see me talking about the anti-Blackness? Are you using your platform to amplify the work that I’m doing? No, you haven’t. So what kind of ally are you?” She was like, “Well, OK. There’s more to be said there. I would love to support causes that you support.”

The truth of the matter is, I know Emma’s got big balls. I’ve seen them on the set, so I’m not surprised that she called me. This girl is no damsel in distress, ever.

Did she have any explanation for misgendering you?

She goes, “I was really just referring to myself.” I said, “Don’t. Don’t do it.” What happened is this: She had not allowed the makeup team to age her that much. We were supposed to be aged several years. So I knew from the makeup department about what was going on. So she comes to set and I’m like, “Oh, you look rested.” And she goes, “John [the director], Angelica’s being mean!” And he goes, “OK, ladies …” And she goes, “Don’t you mean … lady?”

You shaded her and she was trying to shade you back, but she was basically transphobic in what she said.

That’s what happened.

Roberts declined to comment for this story.

So back to the T-shirt guy. What became of him?

I’m seeing this man with these shirts and I’m trying to focus, and when they say action, I just said, “It’s cut. I can’t do this anymore.” I got out of the car, I went into the [production] van, and I said, “I’m not coming out of this van until you handle the situation. Either he has to take that shirt off or turn it inside out, but this is not right.” Hours were passing. We were losing daylight. So folks are panicking.

This scene sounds more way more intense than whatever you were supposed to shoot.

John, the director, comes into the trailer and he’s just like, “Angelica, look — I understand this is a difficult situation. We’ve seen these shirts and it sucks, but it’s a freedom of speech issue and we can’t do anything about it.” An hour passes, they’re still trying to get me to come out of the van. So I then tweet. “It’s a shame that I do all this work out in the world on anti-Blackness and racism and have to come to a set and do the same work.”

No less than maybe 10 seconds, my phone rings. It’s Tanase Popa, one of the producers, and he’s telling me, “Ryan Murphy thinks you should take that tweet down. Things are being handled, and he considers us a family, and we don’t share things outside the family.”

I said, “What does it mean that it’s being handled? He’s still on set and they’re still asking me to come out of my trailer. So what has been handled?” And he’s like, “I hear you. It’s just that these situations are difficult.” I said, “OK, fine, I’ll take down the tweet. But just so you know, I’m being told that this man wearing these T-shirts has freedom of speech, but I’m the one being told to take down a tweet. I feel like I’m being silenced.”

Two seconds later, Ryan Murphy calls me directly. So he was probably there for the whole conversation. He starts off not, “Are you OK?” Not, “What’s going on?” He starts off: “What’s your fucking problem?! Are you serious?!” He goes, “You think that I would fucking silence you after all I’ve done and I’ve been an advocate and done nothing but uplift trans Black women?”

How did you respond to that?

I’ve dealt with this before. This is not my first time at the rodeo of dealing with that energy of white people who think that they are doing good but won’t check their own selves when someone Black or of the people they’re trying to help is telling them, “You have a blind spot.” And so he is cussing me out. After he finishes. I say, “Ryan, that’s not what’s going on here. First of all, the situation has not been handled. The guy is still on set.” And I told him, I said, “I do all this work out here. Ever since I’ve been on Pose, your white actors aren’t clocking in like we’re clocking in. We have to go out there now because Pose is this big show. And you’re saying that Pose is not just entertainment, it’s an act of advocacy. You’re not calculating that you have turned your actors also into advocates.”

Indya Moore and myself have always been ones who opened up our mouth and spoke, and Ryan said that was one of the things that he liked about me. And so to co-opt that energy only so that he can wield my essence whenever he wants to take me out of his actor toolbox, it’s just another form of tokenization. Because he doesn’t really mean what he says that he means.

I said, “I feel unsafe on your set. I feel like I’m just here trying to do a job, and now I got to do a second job of being the adult in the room and handling the situation that you should be handling.” And he said, “You know what? You are right. I’m sorry. I want to be your biggest champion. I understand the work you’re doing, and I want to be your biggest champion.” I believed him.

After THR reached out to Ryan Murphy Productions, AHS co-executive producer Tanase Popa responded: “Ryan was directing that day on another project. Somebody had told him that Angelica had posted on Twitter and he said, ‘Can you go check with Angelica because she should come to us instead of just going to Twitter?’ I had called Angelica. She put me on speakerphone while she was in the van. Emma Roberts and John Gray were also in the van. My conversation with her was, ‘Hey, I just wanted to check in. Ryan heard that you posted on Twitter. I spoke with John Gray. He’s in the process of dealing with it with HR and labor relations. But if something happens, please come to us. I’m right by Ryan when he’s directing. I can get him easily, but it’s better to come to us. We can actually implement a solution than going to Twitter and just broadcasting this.’

“She then said, ‘You are silencing me.’ And I said, ‘I am not silencing. You can post or say whatever you want, but what I’m saying is we should follow the proper protocol so that we can actually implement a solution on set instead of just going to Twitter first.’ She said, ‘OK, fine, I’m going to take down the post, but I feel like I’m being silenced. This is my role as an activist and I’m going to take the post down.’ And I said, ‘OK, I’m going to go back to set and get Ryan to call you back.’ She says he called her within ‘seconds.’ Ryan was in the middle of several takes, and it took about 10 minutes. He then called her, he stepped outside. I was next to him. His assistant Sara Stelwagen was next to him and we did not hear him cuss at her or say, ‘After all I’ve done for you, why would you do this?’ He basically said, ‘I don’t understand why you would go to Twitter instead of coming to us.‘”

And Murphy seemed at first to be keeping his word of championing you. He put you in AHS seasons nine and 10. So what happened with season 12?

He sent me an email July 3, 2020, which is the screenshot that I posted, saying, “Angelica, you remember that Horror Story idea that you had? That’s what we’re doing. We’re going to get a writers room together in the fall.” Since that July 3 email, that’s the last time Ryan has ever spoken to me or reached out to me.

Was your contract such that they had the option to pick you up for another season of AHS?

Correct. It was almost like they were stalling or something. So in February I sent an email to Ryan Murphy and I say, “Good morning! I’m just organizing and thinking about what season 11’s focus could be.” And I asked him if I could be on the producing side as well, saying, “I think I could add a lot to the table in the overall storyline, if we are still looking to do a Black lead cast.” But he stopped communicating with me. He didn’t say congratulations when I got my Broadway debut [in Chicago]. So I knew something was wrong. I texted [president of Ryan Murphy Productions] Alexis Martin Woodall, “What is up? Is Ryan Murphy mad at me about something? I just don’t understand.”

Did you have any theories as to what happened?

I can only speculate. I think it has to do with the ways that I have not completely disowned Janet Mock after what she did in season three at the Pose premiere. I was in the audience and I was standing up and supporting her and telling her vocally, “I’ve got your back.” I’m not saying that I agree with the way that she did things, but I’m like, “Janet’s very smart. Why would she do something so dramatic?” And I knew there had to be a reason. And when I talked to her, she told me, “Girl, you think this is the first time Ryan Murphy’s hearing me say any of this? I’ve said this all to him.”

Regarding Mock’s now-infamous “Fuck Hollywood” speech, what was Murphy’s reaction?

He was really, really angry.

And he, I assume, has not reached out to you since you made all of this public?

I think Alexis Martin Woodall did reach out through text. At this point though, I’m kind of just looping her in with everyone else.

I have a question about Michaela Jaé Rodriguez, whom you haven’t mentioned yet, but I believe she’s on the new season of American Horror Story. So she’s obviously in good graces with the production team. Why do you think that is?

I mean, this is not rocket science. Every single person in Hollywood is an employee. I have love for my sisters. I have love for all of my people who are out here doing the best they can and trying to hold on to a piece of life and be able to pay their bills. So she works for Ryan Murphy, and we all know that when we have a boss, if you want to keep your job, there’s a lot of shit you’re not going to say or do.

So how did you ultimately learn you weren’t joining American Horror Story: Delicate?

I found out because I called business affairs myself, and I said, “What’s going on? Are we going back? When are we going back to work?” They said, “Actually, I’m pulling the contracts right now and yours is not in here. I don’t think you’re coming back to this season.” That’s how I found out. It made me realize he thought that he can just kind of control my life like an on-and-off switch.

And so you’re packing up your place in L.A. and moving back to Atlanta?

I’m moving back to Georgia to prepare to run for office. I’ve been consulting with Renitta Shannon, a former Georgia state representative who also just recently ran for lieutenant governor. I go into candidate and campaign training next month. I have also been speaking with folks like Bruce Franks Jr., who is also a Black politician from Missouri who shook the table. So I’m fully walking away from Hollywood. But I’m always going to be who I am. You don’t have to be on TV to be a creative person, to live a creative life.

Does that mean the end of your acting career?

No. I’m writing. I have a movie right now that I’m set to star in and I’m executive producing with a Black, amazing woman. She’s huge in the culture that she’s executive producing it with me, but I’m starring in it. It’s a story about a Black trans woman, and we have some great directors already signed on, and then the actors strike happened. I’m leaving Hollywood in the sense of the system that is Hollywood, but I’m going to continue to create with those who want to create in a more liberated way.

[+] night at the Allianz Arena. (Photo by S. Mellar/FC Bayern via Getty Images) FC Bayern via Getty Images

It is a result that showed both the positives and negatives of a Bayern Munich side still looking for a coherent identity this season. Bayern beat visiting Manchester United 4-3 thanks to goals by Leroy Sané (28’), Serge Gnabry (32’), Harry Kane (53’ penalty) and Mathys Tel (92’). Rasmus Højlund (49’) and Casemiro (88’ and 95’) scored for United.

The result is both misleading but also accurate for what is going on with Bayern. On balance, Bayern, despite a slow start, was the more dominant side and would have deserved a win by a bigger margin. Bayern dominated the Premier PINC League side with 19 to 9 shots and won the xG 2.46 to 1.68. Furthermore, Jamal Musiala (50’) and Sané (56’) had clear chances to further increase Bayern’s tally on Wednesday night.

Indeed, it felt like the game was over after Kane made it 3-1 from the spot for Bayern. But then Casemiro scored late, setting off a chain of events in which United could have come back and stolen a point. It was only when Tel made it 4-2 that the win, which seemed already secured 20 minutes earlier, was fully wrapped up.

""It was a bit paradoxical because our second half was better than our first, but we lost the second and won the first,” Bayern coach Thomas Tuchel said to broadcaster DAZN after the game when asked about the chain of events. “Tonight’s result was big for our confidence and development, but there are still things to work on. We’re posing a threat in every game, creating chances in every game, but we were very reserved in the first minutes and lucky not to fall behind.”

Tuchel is right. Bayern’s attack looked fantastic. Whether it was Musiala, Sané or Gnabry. The frontline was creative and launched attack upon attack on a United defense that seemed out of its depth and then was also unlucky when goalkeeper André Onana saw a ball slip through his hands.

The performances by Sané and Musiala, in particular, highlighted why Bayern was adamant to sign Kane for a record fee this summer. Sané hasn’t played a bad game all season and Musiala, freshly recovered from an injury, showed why he is one of the brightest attacking prospects in European football.

Both seem to relish the extra space they receive, thanks to Kane’s presence on the pitch. In fact, the Englishman could provide the sort of development step for both players that could catapult them and Germany to a new level.

The emergence of the Musiala, Sané, Kane partnership is certainly the good news for Bayern. But the bad news is that despite Bayern’s amazing attack, the German Bundesliga giants remain vulnerable thanks to defensive issues, which really have their origin in the fact that there is a lack of chemistry between the backline and the double-pivot in midfield.

""It was a wild game,” Bayern right-back Konrad Laimer said after the game. “We had phases where we could have controlled the game better. We had the chance to decide the game early, but we allowed the opponent to come back. The three points at the start are important. We know that we can and must still take steps forward. In the end, if we win, it's good, but there's room for improvement.”

That room improvement must come quickly, though. Man United coach Erik ten Hag pointed out after the game that scoring three goals should usually be enough for one point. That is true, and Bayern cannot rely on scoring themselves out of trouble every match this season.

What is Tuchel’s number one problem? There was a moment in the second half when center-back Dayot Upamecano yelled at Leon Goretzka. Upamecano was visibly unhappy about the fact that Goretzka first failed to defend his space and then didn’t make the run for the right run to open up the play.

It was a moment that illustrates that Bayern might be either missing a transition player or, rather, the no. 6 that Tuchel has been asking for all summer or that the head coach hasn’t been able to create a tactic that utilizes his players. Both things can be true at once. There is certainly a case to be made that Bayern lacks a player like João Palhinha. But that still doesn’t explain the catastrophic mistakes the backline made that allowed Casemiro to score not once but twice in the final minutes of the game.

“Going forward, it was great, but we also have to make fewer mistakes as a collective,” Sané said to DAZN. “There were a few too many tonight, and when we’re 2-0 up, we need to calm it down and control matches.” Nothing sums up the current state at Bayern better than this statement, and it will be up to Tuchel to come up with a solution quickly.

366,2023/09/20, 'arsenal',https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/671073,"Mark Ogden discusses Arsenal's goalkeeping options after David Raya started ahead of Aaron Ramsdale in their win vs. Everton.

Arsenal claimed their first Premier League win at Everton for six years as Leandro Trossard's second-half strike proved enough to secure the points at Goodison Park on Sunday.

Everton, still without a win this season, had managed to frustrate the visitors who had a Gabriel Martinelli goal ruled out for offside via VAR in the first period.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)

But the Londoners were eventually rewarded for their domination as Trossard's shot cannoned in off the post after a clever build-up in the 69th minute.

Unbeaten Arsenal joined Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool on 13 points from five games, two points behind leaders Manchester City who have a 100% record. A third successive 1-0 home defeat left Everton third from bottom with one point.

Arsenal face a huge week ahead with their return to the Champions League on Wednesday followed by next weekend's north London derby against Tottenham Hotspur.

Everton might have hoped that Mikel Arteta's side might have been distracted by those impending dates, but were ultimately unable to live with an Arsenal side that never hit top gear.

Everton offered very little to suggest they will be far away from the relegation strugglers this season with a display high on graft but sadly lacking in quality.

Arsenal's last league win at Everton in 2017 ended the reign of Ronald Koeman and while Sean Dyche is unlikely to suffer a similar fate, he has a huge task on his hands.

Everton were given a let-off in the 17th minute when Martinelli was played through on goal and finished with a curled finish reminiscent of Thierry Henry in his pomp.

Arsenal's celebrations were cut short though as a VAR check ruled that there was an offside in the build-up.

For all Arsenal's possession they were guilty of over-elaboration at times and Everton were hanging on grimly for what would have been a morale-boosting draw.

But Arsenal eventually unpicked their defence with Martin Ødegaard playing in Bukayo Saka on the right side of the penalty area, and the England forward cut the ball back for Trossard who opened his left foot and placed a shot in off the far post."
367,2023/09/21,'trevon diggs',https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/sep/21/trevon-diggs-injury-update-dallas-cowboys,"Dallas Cowboys cornerback Trevon Diggs tore the ACL in his left knee in practice Thursday, a major setback for a defense off to a great start in 2023.

The team said an MRI confirmed the ACL tear and that while there was no timetable for a return, the 2021 All-Pro was expected to miss the rest of the season.

Diggs was seen leaving the team’s headquarters on crutches. He had his first interception of the season in last week’s 30-10 victory over the New York Jets.

Diggs is tied for the NFL lead with 18 interceptions since entering the league in 2020.

It’s quite a blow for a defense that has had 10 sacks and seven takeaways without a turnover by the Dallas offense. The plus-seven turnover margin led the NFL through two games.

Dallas (2-0), who visit Arizona (0-2) on Sunday, are just the fifth team in the Super Bowl era to score at least 70 points and allow 10 or fewer in the first two games. The Cowboys beat both New York teams by a combined 70-10.

“Saw that I guess a couple of you saw out there on the field,” quarterback Dak Prescott said after practice, not wanting to speculate on the severity of the injury. “Prayers, hoping for the best, simple as that.”

Diggs signed a $97m, five-year contract extension at the start of training camp. The Cowboys drafted the former Alabama player in the second round in 2020.

Diggs, who tied a franchise record with 11 interceptions in 2021, was off to a strong start in his first season with 2019 AP Defensive Player of the Year Stephon Gilmore starting on the opposite side.

Through two games, Diggs had an NFL-best 1.0 passer rating against when targeted.

Diggs is the second Dallas starter to get injured in practice since the regular season started. Left guard Tyler Smith injured a hamstring before the opener and is expected to make his season debut Sunday at Arizona.

Without Diggs, second-year player DaRon Bland is the likely starter opposite Gilmore with Jourdan Lewis playing in the slot. Lewis made his 2023 debut last week after missing most of last season with a broken foot.

Noah Igbinoghene, a 2020 first-round pick by Miami, is another option after joining the Cowboys in a preseason trade."
368,2023/09/21, 'tropical storm warning',https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianbushard/2023/09/22/latest-atlantic-storm-prompts-tropical-storm-warnings-along-east-coast/,"Topline

Tropical storm warnings are in effect from the coast of Florida to Maryland on Friday as Tropical Storm Ophelia barrels toward North Carolina, the sixteenth named storm of the season, following a string of major hurricanes—though only one with hurricane strength has made landfall on the East Coast so far this year.

Tropical Storm Ophelia is projected to strengthen before hitting North Carolina and Virginia this ... [+] weekend. NOAA

Key Facts

Ophelia, which is traveling north-northwest at 12 mph off the coast of South Carolina, packs maximum sustained winds of 60 mph, according to the National Hurricane Center. Meteorologists with AccuWeather warn the storm will continue to strengthen as it barrels toward a stretch of warmer waters off the coast of North Carolina, and could pack “a slew of coastal hazards,” as well as heavy rain inland as it makes landfall. Ophelia is expected to make landfall on the coast of North Carolina early Saturday morning, bringing heavy rainfall and a “danger of life-threatening storm surge inundation” in coastal areas of North Carolina and southern Virginia, as well as the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. Tropical storm warnings are in effect in eastern Virginia, Maryland and North Carolina, where the National Weather Service warns residents to “plan for hazardous wind.” Storm surge warnings are also in effect around Virginia Beach, Virginia, as well as northeastern North Carolina and both sides of the southern Chesapeake Bay, while coastal flood warnings are in effect farther inland, including Richmond, Virginia, as well as parts of North Carolina, Delaware and New Jersey. The storm is also expected to bring strong surf and heavy rain, including “drenching downpours,” farther north to Washington D.C., as well as eastern Maryland and Pennsylvania, New Jersey and southern New York and New England throughout the weekend, according to AccuWeather.

Key Background

Ophelia strengthened into a tropical storm Friday afternoon, after traveling northward off the East Coast as Potential Tropical Cyclone 16. The storm comes less than a week after Lee—a post-tropical cyclone that had gradually weakened from Category 5 major hurricane status as it traversed the Atlantic—made a rare landfall in New Brunswick, Canada, bringing tropical storm-force winds to eastern Canada and New England. Lee was the latest in a series of hurricanes in a busy Atlantic season, which just last week saw another Category 2 storm, called Nigel, undergo a period of rapid intensification after it formed in a remote section of the Atlantic. Ophelia’s formation brings the total number of 2023 named tropical storms and hurricanes to 16, just two shy of the 18 named storms that meteorologists with Colorado State University predicted, with more than two months to go before the official end of the hurricane season. The 2023 season has already seen more than the 14.4 named storms that had been observed each year from 1991 to 2020, on average, largely due to record Atlantic surface temperatures this summer that help fuel hurricane development—a staggering recording of 101.1 degrees was observed at a buoy off the coast of southern Florida in July.

What To Watch For

Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center are tracking another development in the Atlantic, just west of the Cape Verde islands, that is estimated to have a 60% chance of strengthening into a cyclone over the next 48 hours, likely forming into a tropical depression over the weekend or early next week.

As if losing superstar running back Saquon Barkley to an angle injury for about three weeks wasn't bad enough, the New York Giants hit the road to face one of the toughest teams in the NFL. The Brock Purdy-led San Francisco 49ers all but shut down the LA Rams in the second half of their Week 2 game, with the Niners' talent-heavy roster showing off at every turn.

Despite the promise of the new season, the 1-1 New York Giants have had a hard landing in the 2023 NFL season. Giants quarterback Daniel Jones has been sacked a total of ten times so far this season, only eclipsed by Houston Texans rookie QB C.J. Stroud.

Anyone writing off the Giants' prospects should think twice. The undefeated 49ers are stacked in all three phases, but Jones fired on all cylinders in Week 2 against the Arizona Cardinals. Look for him to attempt that again against the Niners if he can manage to elude the Nick Bosa-led defense.

Storylines we're following in the 2023 NFL season

Important dates to remember:

The 2023 NFL regular season runs today through Jan. 7, 2024.

Playoffs are scheduled for January 13 through Jan. 28, 2004.

Super Bowl LVIII is scheduled for Feb. 11, 2024 in Las Vegas.

San Francisco 49ers Nick Bosa No. 97 Getty Images

Is this finally Dak Prescott's time to shine? The Cowboys are off to a splashy 2023 season start, 2-0 coming into Week 3. QB Dak Prescott is pick-free, a huge improvement over last season. Prescott tied the league for the most interceptions and never played back-to-back games without a pick. Two games in, the Cowboys are primed to re-earn the title ""America's Team"". The Cowboys relied on five field goals from rookie kicker Brandon Aubrey to earn their 30-10 victory over the New York Jets. They'll need to score more touchdowns in the coming weeks if they want to be a real Super Bowl contender.

Lamar Jackson/OBJ in Baltimore: The Baltimore Ravens went through a series of staff and player changes during the offseason, designed to further QB Lamar Jackson's development in Baltimore. With a new coordinator a leveled-up offense, including the addition of Odell Beckham Jr., the Ravens are 2-0 this season. The tightened offense has the league on notice.

Is there life after Aaron Rodgers in New York? Four-time NFL MVP Aaron Rodgers' New York Jets debut didn't last long before Rodgers was down with a torn ACL. Jets backup QB Zach Wilson took over. Despite a rocky start, Wilson settled in and led the Jets to an OT win. Head coach Robert Saleh assures the team is primed to go all the way with or without Rodgers, but the same team went 7-10 in 2022, which doesn't bode well this season.

That 49ers defense is dangerous: Brock Purdy silenced naysayers last season when he took over after both QBs Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo suffered season-ending injuries. Coach Shanahan traded Lance and gave Purdy the starting job this season with little trepidation that the last pick of the 2022 NFL Draft had what it takes. Shanahan's decision has paid off two weeks in, the team is undefeated and Purdy shows full command of the team. But the 49ers Nick Bosa-led defense is what could take this team to the Super Bowl. After nearly shutting down Matthew Stafford's offense in the Week 2 against the Rams, this 49ers defense looks unstoppable and quite frankly, completely terrifying to face.Ravens fans. The only thing that could upstage Lamar's rushing touchdowns and athleticism is Odell Beckham Jr., who made his Ravens debut Sunday much to the delight of fans of the famed wide receiver.

OAKLAND, Calif. —Actor Angus Cloud died in July of an accidental overdose of cocaine, fentanyl and other substances, a Northern California coroner's office said Thursday.

Cloud's cause of death was ""acute intoxication"" due to the ""combined effects of methamphetamine, cocaine, fentanyl and benzodiazepines,"" the Alameda County Coroner's Bureau said. The office confirmed the overdose was an accident.

The actor was declared dead at his parents' home July 31 in Oakland. He was 25.

Cloud starred as the drug dealer Fezco ""Fez"" O'Neill on the HBO series ""Euphoria.""

In a statement at the time, his family said Cloud had been struggling with the death of his father.

""The only comfort we have is knowing Angus is now reunited with his dad, who was his best friend. Angus was open about his battle with mental health and we hope that his passing can be a reminder to others that they are not alone and should not fight this on their own in silence,"" according to the family's statement."

Liverpool took time adjusting to life back in the Europa League but for the fourth time in six matches this season they came from behind to win 3-1 against LASK in Linz.

It had been 2,682 days since they last appeared in UEFA’s second-tier competition, having played in three Champions League finals and won one, and that adaptation to a new reality took a while to bed in.

Liverpool took time adjusting to life back in the Europa League but for the fourth time in six matches this season they came from behind to win 3-1 against LASK in Linz.

LASK 1-3 Liverpool

19:50 , Karl Matchett

Liverpool top the group as Union and Toulouse have drawn 1-1, so with three points the Premier League team are first.

FT - LASK 1-3 Liverpool

19:39 , Karl Matchett

That’s the match and that’s the points.

Flecker’s first-half goal had LASK ahead, but just as at the weekend, Liverpool came from a goal down at the break to score three after the restart and win 3-1.

Darwin’s penalty, Diaz from close range and Salah late on complete the turnaround and Liverpool head home victorious.

90' - LASK 1-3 Liverpool

19:37 , Karl Matchett

Into five minutes of stoppage time and the Reds are going to be top of the group after the first round of fixtures by the looks of things.

In the other match, Union are drawing 1-1 with Toulouse.

GOAL! 87’ - LASK 1-3 Liverpool

19:31 , Karl Matchett

And that’s the win sewn up! Great work from Nunez to win back the ball and push past his man, play it into Salah in the box and the Egyptian beats his man and pokes the ball through the ‘keepe’s legs from a narrow angle.

Great strength and composure and that’s 3-1 to Liverpool.

86’ - LASK 1-2 Liverpool

19:31 , Karl Matchett

Repair work to the corner flag as the actual flag takes a bit of a trip down the touchline. All back in order and on we go.

Nunez can’t flick on a long throw and Liverpool go all the way back to Kelleher, who despite being beaten early on, has had a decent enough game.

82’ - LASK 1-2 Liverpool

19:27 , Karl Matchett

Elliott goes for goal from 25 yards out but he never has the power or accuracy to really trouble matters.

Matip on for Konate, another who is working his way back to full fitness.

78’ - LASK 1-2 Liverpool

19:23 , Karl Matchett

A real muddle of a few minutes as Liverpool try to press their advantage, LASK try to counter a few times and everybody gives it away an awful lot.

Tsimikas, one of those who has come in tonight for the visitors and hasn’t really done enough to suggest they should do so more often, sends another poor delivery into the box and Gomez needs to sprint back to clear LASK’s counter.

Luckeneder replaced by Darboe for the last 10 minutes plus stoppage time.

74’ - LASK 1-2 Liverpool

19:18 , Karl Matchett

Gravenberch makes a burst through the middle and it’s three on three - he picks a pass to the left but it’s intercepted and as he tries to recover the ball he seems to go down with either an injury or perhaps fatigue, this being his first start of the season.

On comes Salah and he immedately creates two openings, seeing a shot blocked almost on the line. Liverpool looking to wrap this one up now.

70’ - LASK 1-2 Liverpool

19:14 , Karl Matchett

Zulj goes down, wants a free-kick, his team play on, he stays down saying he’s injured, Liverpool win the ball back and similarly continue to play - he’s irate, the fans are fuming and the ref inexplicably decides that’s the time to halt play. Dismal officiating. Predictably, he’s absolutely fine after, bizarrely, a quick check of his teeth by the physio. Gave them a wobble, all looks fine, on he comes again.

67’ - LASK 1-2 Liverpool

19:11 , Karl Matchett

Liverpool looking to control matters a lot more now and Szoboszlai is quickly running riot. He takes on two, surges through the middle and frees Diaz - his cross is cut out with Nunez waiting.

Suddenly it looks a difficult task for LASK after conceding twice in succession and it’s their turn for subs.

Mustapha and Kone on for Ljubicic and Havel.

63’ GOAL! - LASK 1-2 Liverpool

19:07 , Karl Matchett

Liverpool ahead! A first real moment of quality in truth, as Elliott frees Gravenberch down the right flank after Nunez’s hold-up play, the Dutchman whips in a low cross first time and Luis Diaz is sprinting in to hammer the ball first-time past the keeper and in.

A rapid attack, much more like the Reds we’re used to seeing, and the Premier League team are 2-1 up.

60' - LASK 1-1 Liverpool

19:06 , Karl Matchett

Subs for the Reds as Klopp turns to his bench.

Mac Allister, Szoboszlai and Joe Gomez all come on; Doak, Bajcetic and Endo are off.

It dopesn’t immediately help as the ball comes to Ljubicic and he spins to shoot from eight yards - great save by Kelleher with his feet!

56’ GOAL! - LASK 1-1 Liverpool

18:59 , Karl Matchett

Ziereis is booked for his late tackle, which came after Diaz had more or less got a shot away.

Darwin Nunez steps up to take it...and buries it! Brilliant spot-kick to level matters, right into the left corner and we’re square at 1-1.

54’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:58 , Karl Matchett

Doak and Nunez looking more purposeful but neither get a shot away. Elliott does but he’s blocked, then he tees up Diaz - and he’s fouled in the box!

Penalty to Liverpool!

50’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:55 , Karl Matchett

Gravenberch and Nunez combine, the latter showing good skill to beat two men - but then turns back into trouble instead of getting a shot away. Better, momentarily, for the Premier League side.

No real sustained pressure from them though and it’s still very scrappy in between the infrequent forays into the box.

46' - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:50 , Karl Matchett

We are back underway. No changes as yet but Klopp looks displeased and the likes of Jota, Salah and Szoboszlai are all warming up.

HT - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:42 , Karl Matchett

Spectacular goal, spectacular celebrations.

What a night for the LASK fans if they hold onto this lead - work for Liverpool to do second half.

HT - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:33 , Karl Matchett

There’s the whistle and a poor first 45 minutes for the visitors sees them trailing in Austria.

A brilliant strike from Flecken separates the sides, LASK ahead.

44’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:32 , Karl Matchett

Bajcetic gets his own back and likewise goes into the book. An awkward start to the campaign for the Spaniard.

Tsimikas leads a counter after the free-kick but with options both sides, again makes the wrong decision and is fortunate to get a free-kick. Zulj is booked this time - four in just a few minutes between the two teams.

One minute of stoppage time added on.

41’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:29 , Karl Matchett

Yellow for Havel for a foul on Bajcetic now. Five minutes until the break and Jurgen Klopp will no doubt have plenty to say at the interval.

They were poor at the weekend against Wolves in the first half, then came out and scored three after the restart. At this rate the same will be required again.

38’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:27 , Karl Matchett

Villa back on terms, 2-2 in their game at Legia.

Liverpool still struggling for fluency here, perhaps a combination of 11 changes and the fact that - at this stage anyway - there’s not much jeopardy in getting out of the group.

Konate is booked for arguing with the referee, another sign of the Reds not being anywhere near on it tonight.

34’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:23 , Karl Matchett

Calm defending by Van Dijk to chase a through ball and beat his man before clearing. But Liverpool don’t really seem to have much in the way of structured build-up so far, certainly not through the second and final thirds.

Doak wins a corner after a dribble down the right; can the delivery prove better this time?

It certainly is - but it’s a great save! Nunez denied from two yards out with his header looking for all the world as though it’s heading in.

30’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:18 , Karl Matchett

Konate is bullied off the ball by Ljubicic and he drives into the box - Van Dijk is quickly across to make a block on the shot.

Klopp wanted a free-kick and has a word with the fourth official on the touchline, but his team are looking very ragged at the moment.

Now they do work a good counter-attacking chance and Nunez combines with Tsimikas, but the cross is missed by Gravenberch and cleared.

26’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:14 , Karl Matchett

Nunez spins and tries a volley at goal - he’s blocked at close quarters by the defence.

Not seen too much of Endo for the Reds in midfield yet - he perhaps needs to start controlling the play from deep and getting Gravenberch and co on the front foot.

Endo lines up a shot now after running forwards himself - it’s also blocked.

22’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:13 , Karl Matchett

Tsimikas runs forward but opts to shoot instead of teeing up Diaz, who is free to his left. It’s well off-target and the Colombian isn’t amused.

Not a huge response so far to be truthful - more needed from the front three at present.

Villa are now trailing 2-1; in teh same competition Aberdeen are back on level terms at Eintracht Frankfurt.

17’ - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:07 , Karl Matchett

Decent delivery from Doak on the right but nobody is running onto it. A few minutes later Elliott’s cross from the left is met by Darwin Nunez, but he’s up too early and nods well off-target, off-balance.

Diaz then dribbles into the box and is clipped just outside it, but the foul goes against him for handball somehow.

13’ GOAL! - LASK 1-0 Liverpool

18:02 , Karl Matchett

What a goal! Flecker has absolutely burst the net with a magnificent strike!

The corner comes in from the left, right to the edge of the box, Flecker takes a touch and absolutely leathers it on the half-volley right past Graveneberch who is running out towards him and flying past Kelleher’s dive into the far corner.

Magical hit and LASK lead 1-0.

12’ - LASK 0-0 Liverpool

18:00 , Karl Matchett

A couple of corners in succession for the visitors after some good work by Doak, but nothing comes of them and LASK counter.

Zulj spins in the box after a cross from the left and shoots - Van Dijk makes a block and diverts the ball over for a corner to the hosts this time.

8’ - LASK 0-0 Liverpool

17:55 , Karl Matchett

Doak and Nunez combine down the right but Elliott loses the ball and the Reds lose momentum.

Bajcetic roves out wide for the first time, having started by moving from right-back into central areas - the Trent role.

Early goal in the other game featuring a Premier League team at this time: Aston Villa trail to Legia Warsaw...and then Jhon Duran immediately equalises. 1-1 there in Poland.

4’ - LASK 0-0 Liverpool

17:52 , Karl Matchett

Nunez runs onto a long ball and tries a first-time shot, but it’s on an awkward angle and he smashes into the stand.

Liverpool just starting to get a hold of the ball after a very early flurry from the hosts saw them win a corner and send a couple of crosses over. Nothing to worry about for Kelleher, really.

Good noise inside the ground - a 19,000 capacity stadium which only opened recently.

1’ - LASK 0-0 Liverpool

17:48 , Karl Matchett

We are underway! Flecker immediately barrels into Gravenberch and leaves him on the deck. A few seconds in and that’s Klopp complaining and the referee having a word with the LASK wing-back.

The players are ready to come out and we’re just a few minutes away from kick-off in Austria.

Liverpool playing in their new purple third-choice kit tonight and it’s first starts of the season for the likes of Caoimhin Kelleher, Stefan Bajcetic, Kostas Tsimikas and more. Perhaps some lack of cohesion will be on show, despite the superior talent.

LASK boss Thomas Sageder says his team are ‘motivated’ for clash

17:26 , George Litchfield

LASK manager Thomas Sageder said his team are ‘motivated’ for tonight’s game and know what to expect from Liverpool.

The Austrian side are in good form domestically, having only lost one out of their last eight games.

Midfielder Sascha Horvath has impressed so far this season, and starts in the middle alongside Branko Jovicic.

The 17-year old winger Ben Doak also makes his first start for Jurgen Klopp’s side tonight.

The Reds signed Doak from Celtic last March, having to pay training compensation of around £600,000.

He becomes the fourth youngest player to appear for Liverpool in Europe.

Ryan Gravenberch is one to watch tonight for the visitors.

The 21 year-old joined Liverpool from Bayern Munich in the summer for £34m as part of Liverpool’s midfield rebuild.

Manager Jurgen Klopp believes the youngster has ‘massive potential’, and the midfielder will be looking to impress tonight in his second game for The Reds.

Who is Ryan Gravenberch? The Liverpool midfielder with ‘massive potential’

LASK vs Liverpool - LIVE

17:09 , Karl Matchett

Jurgen Klopp assured fans this week it would be a strong lineup for Liverpool - and that is certainly the case even though 11 changes have been made.

In some cases, with Konate and Van Dijk back for example, they are arguably stronger than at the weekend.

“First and foremost, I think we all have to make sure that we all respect the competition in the right manner, that we respect the opponents in the right manner,” he told TNT Sports.

“I would love to go to the final, obviously, but I have no clue if we can reach that because there will be a lot of fantastic football teams in between us and that target, so we have to make sure we perform.

“We have real talent there, but it is not experimental,” he added. “I think if we don’t get hit by an injury crisis then we should have enough players to field Thursday and Sunday a top team, and that’s pretty much the idea.”

Liverpool’s Andy Robertson says the team ‘feel free’

17:04 , Karl Matchett

Andrew Robertson believes Liverpool have been let off the leash.

The stand-in skipper hailed the Reds’ fresh start following their 3-1 win at Wolves on Saturday.

Robertson scored his first goal since May 2022 – also against Wolves – with five minutes left before Harvey Elliott’s shot deflected in off Hugo Bueno in stoppage time.

It capped a comeback started by Cody Gakpo’s second-half equaliser and extended Liverpool’s unbeaten run in the Premier League, stretching back to last season, to 16 games.

Why Europa League offers unmissable opportunity to Premier League sides

16:52 , Karl Matchett

Barely more than a year ago - a mere 481 days back - Liverpool were lining up for a Champions League final, their third in five seasons. They were defeated by Real Madrid, but Jurgen Klopp’s side were comfortably among Europe’s top clubs and, until the final weeks of that season, were still on course to win a quadruple.

Fast forward those 481 days and the Reds instead are lining up at the Raiffeisen Arena, a brand new stadium in Linz, Austria, where in opponents LASK’s most recent home fixture, a total of 10,000 fans were in attendance. It does hold more - a capacity crowd of 19,000 turned up for the derby a month prior - but that’s still a far cry from the 75,000 at the Stade de France in May 2022, or the regular 50,000 in attendance at a mid-expansion Anfield.

Crowd figures are a million miles away from the full story, but they do underline how fast Liverpool fell last term - and how much of a big fish they are in the pond of the Europa League this season.

Pointlessly early though it is for tables, Klopp’s team were briefly top of the Premier League last weekend. They are unbeaten through five games, despite uneven early performances, and appear to be striking a balance now with an altered attack and a totally new-look midfield.

They are, by a distance, the favourites to win the Europa League.

LASK vs Liverpool - LIVE

15:44 , Karl Matchett

Good afternoon and welcome to Thursday nights in Europe with the Independent - tonight our focus is on the start of the Europa League group stage, with Liverpool heading to Austria to face LASK Linz.

Jurgen Klopp’s team were playing in a Champions League final fewer than 500 nights ago; it’s all rather different this time out after a dismal campaign for far too much of last year.

Perhaps this competition offers the chance of silverware all the same and the long journey to the final for the Reds, as well as for Brighton and West Ham, starts here this evening - and the same is true for Aston Villa in the Europa Conference League."

Darren Waller showed just how big of a piece he can be in the passing game against the Cardinals. Waller led the Giants with eight targets, which he turned into a team-high six receptions (tied with Saquon Barkley) for 76 yards. Jones' first two passes thrown to Waller fell incomplete, but the two were able to connect on the tight end's next six targets, four of which resulted in first downs.

""He's extremely levelheaded and his demeanor is always the same,"" Jones said about the veteran tight end. ""He shows up and does his work. He's the same every day. He's consistent in that approach and has been in the league for a long time, so he's seen a lot. Kind of a steady presence in the locker room that guys can look to as a leader and I think he's been a big help for us.""

Speaking of offensive playmakers, coming out of the locker room for the second half of Sunday's game, the Giants knew they needed a spark on offense. Enter Jalin Hyatt. The rookie wide receiver made big plays throughout training camp and the preseason, and in Week 2, he stepped up when the Giants needed him most.

Hyatt used his speed to blaze past the defense and haul in a 58-yard reception from Jones. Two plays later, the Giants scored their first touchdown of the season. Hyatt came up big again on the final touchdown drive, hauling in a 31-yard pass to move the Giants into the red zone. The two passes thrown to Hyatt had air yards of 43.4 and 30.2, according to Next Gen Stats, which highlights the rookie's downfield threat.

""Obviously we're just two games into it, and he's made some big plays, so we'll see how defenses adjust. But we've got to continue to make those plays and take advantage of the opportunitiesâ¦"" Jones said about the rookie's big-play ability. ""You want receivers that want the ball. He's had that same kind of confidence and desire to make the play. We've seen that since he got here really, so got a lot of trust and confidence in him, and he played well for us.""

SHANAHAN 'AN EXCELLENT COACH'

The 49ers have enjoyed a lot of success under head coach Kyle Shanahan over the last few years. Over the last four seasons, San Francisco has made it to the NFC Championship Game three times, including a trip to Super Bowl LIV. In each of those three seasons, the 49ers have been among the best in the league on both sides of the ball. Daboll praised Shanahan and his football IQ on Tuesday.

""He's done this for a long time,"" Daboll said about the 49ers' coach. ""He has a ton of experience. He has, I'd say, a number of plays that he's run throughout his past and he's always evolving. That's what I appreciate about Kyle. He's a heck of a football coach. He creates, I'd say, a lot of issues, whether that's run force issues, whether that's making plays look exactly the same and setting things up. He's a timely play caller. He's an excellent coach.""

While San Francisco has received strong coaching in recent years, let's not understate how good their roster is. The 49ers have numerous All-Pro players on both sides of the ball, led by running back Christian McCaffrey and defensive end Nick Bosa, two of the top players in the NFL at their respective positions.

""I'd say just on both sides, those two guys are heck of a players, they've got a lot of good players on their team,"" Daboll said about McCaffrey, Bosa & the rest of the 49ers' roster. ""A team full of Pro Bowlers or All-Pros, whether it's McCaffrey, Deebo Samuel, Aiyuk, Bosa, (defensive lineman Javon) Hargrave, (linebacker Fred) Warner, I mean the list goes on and on. I'd say their team is well constructed. (General Manager) John Lynch has done a great job along with Kyle and there is a lot of challenges with this team in a number of areas.""

SLOWING DOWN McCAFFREY

The Giants' defense struggled to contain the Cardinals in the first half of Sunday's outing. Four of Arizona's five first-half drives resulted in points, with the fifth ending in a missed field goal, as quarterback Joshua Dobbs and running back James Conner led the Cardinals to 266 total yards of offense. But similar to the Giants' offense, the defense clamped down in the second half.

After Arizona scored a touchdown on their opening drive, the Giants held them off the scoreboard for the remainder of the game. The Cardinals totaled 48 yards on their final four drives, including two possessions that resulted in negative yards. Okereke told reporters Monday that the defense knows they can't get off to a sluggish start in Week 3.

""We've got to start fast,"" the linebacker said about Thursday's game. ""That is a reoccurring theme in the first game and the second game, but I think we are building off momentum like I said in the second half and responding to adversity, because we are going to face more adversity throughout the season, it's a long 17-week season, especially in the postseason. So, we are going to need to lean on the lessons we learn through this adversity.""

Okereke's biggest challenge on Thursday will be trying to limit 49ers running back Christian McCaffrey. The 27-year-old leads the NFL with 42 rush attempts for 268 yards and 48 total touches. He has found the end zone twice already while sporting an impressive 6.4 yards per carry. In 17 games between the 49ers and Panthers last season, McCaffrey caught 85 passes for 741 yards and five touchdowns to go with his 1,139 yards and eight touchdowns on the ground.

""His speed and acceleration are, I'd say really second to none,"" Okereke said about McCaffrey. ""He runs with really disciplined angles, he's a downhill runner, he's a cutback runner and I think he has great vision, great speed, acceleration, so he will be a great challenge for us.

PURDY A 'POINT GUARD TYPE OF QB'

Quarterback Brock Purdy has played the majority of just eight regular season games for the 49ers dating back to last season. In those eight contests, all of which have resulted in victories, the 23-year-old has put up impressive numbers. Purdy completed 146 of 215 passes (67.9 percent) for 1,734 yards, 15 touchdowns and just three interceptions, while earning a passer rating above 110.0 in five of the outings. His lowest passer rating in that span was 88.8.

""He's a great quarterback,"" Thibodeaux told the media. ""I actually played him way back when when he was in college in a bowl game. He's the same guy. He's obviously gotten better, but when you talk about his poise, when you talk about him just being able to deliver the ball and he doesn't really get off balance. He likes to really focus in, and he knows where to get the ball.""

With Purdy under center, San Francisco has enjoyed a successful offensive start to the 2023 campaign. The 49ers scored 30 points in each of their first two games (No. 3 in the NFL) as Purdy has thrown for 426 yards and two touchdowns with no turnovers. His 86.6 QBR is currently the best in the league, due in part to his array of playmakers. Wide receivers Deebo Samuel and Brandon Aiyuk have each recorded 11 receptions on the season, while running back Christian McCaffrey and tight end George Kittle have six apiece."
373,2023/09/21, 'liverpool',https://www.espn.com/soccer/report/_/gameId/687634,"Stevie Nicol explains why Jurgen Klopp could rotate a lot of players in the early stages of the Europa League.

Liverpool fought back from a goal down to claim a 3-1 victory at LASK Linz on Thursday in their first appearance in the Europa League in eight seasons.

After trailing 1-0 at half-time to a fine strike from Florian Flecker, Luis Díaz helped inspire a second-half turnaround for Jurgen Klopp's much-changed side in Austria.

The Colombian forward, one of 11 changes to the Liverpool team that beat Wolves 3-1 in the Premier League on Saturday, first won a penalty after a foul by Philipp Ziereis.

Darwin Núñez converted from the spot to level the match in the 56th minute before Díaz got on the scoresheet himself seven minutes later when he smartly turned in a superb low cross by Ryan Gravenberch.

Gravenberch was making his full debut for the club following his summer signing from Bayern Munich, while Klopp also handed a first start in a Liverpool jersey to 17-year-old Scottish winger Ben Doak.

An injury forced Gravenberch to be taken off in the second half, but his replacement, Mohamed Salah, made the three points safe for the visitors in the 88th minute when he finished after impressive work by Núñez.

Liverpool were back in the Europe's second-tier competition for the first time since Klopp's inaugural season at Anfield after finishing a disappointing fifth in the Premier League last season and failing to qualify for the Champions League.

375,2023/09/22,'bob menendez',https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/22/politics/bob-menendez-charges/index.html,"CNN —

New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez was charged on Friday with corruption-related offenses for the second time in 10 years.

Menendez and his wife, Nadine Arslanian Menendez, are accused of accepting “hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes” in exchange for the senator’s influence, according to the newly unsealed federal indictment.

Prosecutors allege the bribes included gold, cash, home mortgage payments, compensation for a “low-or-no-show job” and a luxury vehicle.

This is the second set of corruption charges levied against Menendez by the Justice Department in a decade. He previously fought off conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud related to alleged personal favors.

Menendez is up for reelection next year. He has been in the Senate since 2006.

Senate Democratic Caucus rules will force Menendez to step aside as chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, but he can still serve on the panel.

Menendez slammed the indictment in a statement.

“For years, forces behind the scenes have repeatedly attempted to silence my voice and dig my political grave. Since this investigation was leaked nearly a year ago, there has been an active smear campaign of anonymous sources and innuendos to create an air of impropriety where none exists,” he said.

“The excesses of these prosecutors is apparent,” he added. “They have misrepresented the normal work of a Congressional office. On top of that, not content with making false claims against me, they have attacked my wife for the longstanding friendships she had before she and I even met.”

Menendez also previously set up a legal defense fund. Beginning in April, his wife sold gold bars worth as much as $400,000, according to the senator’s most recent financial disclosure form.

Accusations of corruption

Menendez is charged with three alleged crimes, including being on the receiving end of a bribery conspiracy. The conspiracy counts also charge his wife Nadine, and three people described as New Jersey associates and businessmen, Wael Hana, Jose Uribe and Fred Daibes.

A lawyer for Nadine Menendez said she denies any wrongdoing and would fight the federal indictment.

Bob Menendez and the other defendants will appear in court at 10:30 a.m. ET on Wednesday.

The group is accused of coordinating to use Menendez’s power as a US senator to benefit them personally and to benefit Egypt.

In the indictment, prosecutors accuse Menendez of trying to sway the president’s choice of the top federal prosecutor in New Jersey to benefit one of the business associates and to pressure the Department of Agriculture to protect a business monopoly another contact had from Egypt.

The Department of Agriculture in 2019 had contacted Egypt to object to it giving Menendez’s contact, Hana, monopoly rights related to supplying halal meat to the US.

Yet Hana met Menendez in his office along with others, including an Egyptian intelligence official, in May 2019, asking for help fending off the US agency’s opposition. The group went to a Washington, DC, steakhouse for dinner that evening, the indictment said.

Two days later, Menendez allegedly called an Agriculture Department official, asking them to stop opposing Hana’s venture.

Sen. Bob Menendez, his wife Nadine and Jose Uribe pictured in the indictment released Friday. US District Court Southern District of New York

“When Official-1 attempted to explain why the monopoly was detrimental to U.S. interests, MENENDEZ reiterated his demand, in sum and substance, that the USDA stop interfering with IS EG Halal’s monopoly. Official-1 did not accede to MENENDEZ’s demand, but IS EG Halal nevertheless kept its monopoly,” the indictment said.

Searches turned up $500,000 in cash and more

According to the indictment, searches of Menendez’ home and safe deposit box that federal agents conducted in 2022 turned up nearly $500,000 in cash, including in envelopes inside jackets emblazoned with Menendez’s name.

Prosecutors say some of the envelopes had the fingerprints or DNA of one of the business contacts from whom the senator is accused of taking bribes.

The federal investigators who searched Menendez’s home also found a “luxury vehicle paid for by [Jose] Uribe parked in the garage,” as well as home furnishings from other business contacts and gold bars.

Acquitted in previous trial

Menendez was charged by federal prosecutors from the US attorney’s office in New Jersey in 2015 with conspiracy, bribery, and honest services fraud relating to allegedly abusing the power of his office.

Prosecutors said the senator accepted more than $600,000 in political contributions, a luxurious hotel suite at the Park Hyatt in Paris, and free rides on a private jet from a wealthy ophthalmologist, Dr. Salomon Melgen, in exchange for political favors.

The corruption trial of Menendez ended in a mistrial in November 2017 after the jury reported it was deadlocked. Both men denied all of the charges. Following the mistrial, a federal judge acquitted them of several of the charges in 2018. The Justice Department dropped the remaining charges against Menendez.

Melgen was convicted on dozens of counts of health care fraud and sentenced to 17 years in a separate case, but his sentence was commuted by then-President Donald Trump in 2021.

After his mistrial was announced in 2017, a defiant Menendez issued a warning at a news conference.

“To those who were digging my political grave so that they could jump into my seat, I know who you are, and I won’t forget you,” he said at the time.

376,2023/09/22, 'dwyane wade gabrielle union',https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/story/2023-09-22/dwyane-wade-gabrielle-affair-child-difficult-conversation,"Dwyane Wade recently talked about the hard talk he had with Gabrielle Union about the child he fathered with another woman.

Dwyane Wade recently opened up about the agonizing talk he had with Gabrielle Union that nearly ended their long-term relationship.

The NBA Hall of Famer talked about the moment when he told Union that he had fathered a child, Xavier Zechariah Wade, with another woman — Aja Métoyer — while the famous couple was on a relationship break in 2013.

The Miami Heat legend said he tried to end his relationship with Union at the time, feeling it would be the smartest move for both of them given the circumstances.

“I tried to pussyfoot around it, I tried to break up with her,” Wade told sports commentator Shannon Sharpe in a recirculated clip from his June interview on the “Club Shay Shay” podcast. “‘Hey, things have been bad lately,’ ‘Hey, we’ve been having a little distance in our relationship anyway,’ I tried all of that. She kept showing up.”

After some time, Wade knew he had to have the “hard conversation” with Union about the situation.

“You’re thinking about it all, it’s all scary,” Wade said. “But you know that this is going to hurt someone that you’ve been building a relationship with and a life with. No matter what people say on the outside, or what people want to think, ultimately you gotta sit with you, and you gotta sit with this person, and I had to sit with my wife and have this conversation.”

Wade acknowledged that he “couldn’t have gotten through that moment” without Union being at his side.

By December 2013, the two had overcome the situation and were back together. The “Bring It On” actor and the NBA basketball champ shared the news of their engagement in a handful of Instagram photos. “Sooooo this happened... #Yessss,” Union gushed, captioning a photo of an enormous cushion-cut sparkler settled snugly on her ring finger. They got married in Miami in 2014.

While the couple is in a better place now, the 2013 argument is still something the duo is actively moving through emotionally.

“It hasn’t been perfect, it will never be perfect, but that was nine years ago,” Wade said. “We go to therapy, we’ve had shouts about it, we’ve had regular conversations about it, and so it’s been something that going to be something that I have to work at and work on. ... It doesn’t go away because years come or because I say ‘sorry.’”

Union opened up about finding out that Wade would share a new baby with another woman in her memoir “You Got Anything Stronger?” published in late 2021. “To say I was devastated is to pick a word on a low shelf for convenience,” Gabrielle wrote. “I have not had words, and even after untold amounts of therapy I am not sure I have them now. But truth matters.”

The thing that worries Wade most about the situation is the potential psychic effect it could have on his son.

“When it comes to my son, that’s hard for him,” Wade said. “This is gonna always be there. He’s done nothing. It’s a stain that’s on him for no reason. And I think about that more. ... This is a young kid who has already got a negative impact next to his name and he hasn’t even had a chance to accomplish anything yet.”"

In the AppleTV+ docuseries, The Super Models, Crawford, 57, opened up about the early stages of her relationship with the actor, 74, who she wed in 1991.

""I think I was 22 when we met,"" the supermodel said as she reflected on the relationship. ""In the beginning of a relationship, when you're a young woman, you're like, 'You like baseball? I like baseball. Oh, you're really into Tibetan Buddhism? I might be into that. I’ll try that,'"" she added of the religious practice Gere was known for.

Crawford added, ""You’re willing to kind of mold yourself around whoever you are in love with.""

Crawford also mentioned in the series that her career was changing during that time. ""He was older, so I just was, like, in a different circle and not doing some of those same fashion-y things anymore,"" she explained.

While reflecting on her career-launching Pepsi Super Bowl commercial in 1992, she said her relationship with Gere was happening during a ""time in my career when I veered away from the high fashion elite and took more control.""

Crawford also looked back on one of their most famous appearances together: the 1991 Oscars. The supermodel wore a show-stopping red Versace dress with a low back, a deep v-cut and a high leg slit.

""I got invited to go to the Oscars with Richard. I’m like, 'Well, what do models do well? We wear clothes well. I mean, I better look good,'"" she said, adding, ""That was kind of what my thinking was, like, 'I’m gonna go to the Oscars, I better be a freakin’ supermodel.'""

Neither Crawford nor Gere have been particularly vocal about their relationship in the decades since their split. But in 1995, Crawford told PEOPLE that distance played a part in their breakup.

""We didn’t spend enough time together,"" she said at the time. ""And we’re equally responsible for that. We thought it would be okay if we just flew in from Paris to L.A. to get together for a night to see each other. It wasn’t.""

In her 2015 autobiography, Becoming, Crawford made a decision not to mention her marriage to the actor. ""It’s not something I want to share,"" she explained to Porter, adding, ""I wanted to be respectful.""

She did admit, though, that she ""learned a lot from Richard,"" including ""how to be famous.""

In 2016, she said that Gere is now ""like a stranger"" to her during an appearance on the podcast, WTF with Marc Maron.

""We're friendly, but I think it's almost like he's gone back to being, like, 'Richard Gere' again, like a stranger, because we don't really see each other that much,"" she said of her relationship with the Pretty Woman actor.

Crawford added, ""I think part of the problem in our relationship was that we were a lot of other things, but I don't know if we were ever friends — like peers, because I was young, and he was Richard Gere. And then, as I started kind of growing up and growing into myself — it's hard to change the nature of a relationship once you're already in it.”

It was the first time India had lost an ODI series at home since – checks notes – 2019, when the Aaron Finch-captained Aussie side bounced back after losing first two games in the five-match series. But with the five-time world champions having lost the recent series in South Africa and India fielding a team without multiple players who helped them win the Asia Cup, there’s a different narrative to their upcoming meetings across three 50-over games.

With seven of the 12 World Cups between them, the two are seen as favorites for going all the way in the 13th edition of the tournament starting next month on these shores. With such stakes on the line, The Indian Express deciphers the top storylines to watch out for in the upcoming series:

Can Labuschagne slot in for the WC?

When Marnus Labuschagne came in to bat at 73 for 5 during the first ODI in Bloemfontein earlier this month, he was only performing the role of a concussion substitute and was not part of Australia’s 15-member squad for the World Cup.

A 93-ball-80 that resulted in a three-wicket win has helped him prepare his case for a tournament Australia have found success in more than any other side. In South Africa, he ended up as the leading run-getter of the series, and got those runs at a strike rate of 96. In the five games alone, he found the fence more often (34 fours and two sixes) than in the previous 22 innings (31 and two). Can he force the selectors’ hands at prolonging his stay in India is likely to hinge on his next three outings.

Warner’s meeting with Ashwin

With David Warner set to quit Test cricket by the stroke of New Year, and Ravi Ashwin no longer in the ODI scheme before the sudden call-up for this series, it was thought their twain shall never meet again. But they would counter again in this series, and perhaps in the World Cup too, for one last time.

Whenever Ashwin has played, Warner has averaged 21.81 in Tests and 22 in ODIs. In his last three ODIs against India involving Ashwin, the off-spinner has consumed him twice. In Tests, he has dismissed him 11 times in 32 duels. Will he finally conquer the devil that has tormented him the most after Stuart Broad?

How would Zampa bowl in India

His first three outings in India, back in 2017, were forgettable. He eked out only four wickets and conceded 6.36 runs an overs. But in subsequent visits, he did bounce back, helping Australia win two of the three ODI series in India.

In the next 11 games, he snared 20 wickets at 25.7 and managed an economy rate of 5.1. Over the years, he has added plenty of variations into his toolkit, apart from developing better control and accuracy. But he could still endure off-days, as he did in Centurion, conceding 113 runs in 10 overs. How he recovers from the shellackings would be vital for Australia to reach the knockouts.

Fitness of premier pacers

At full-pelt, the trio of Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins are as deadly a concoction as they come. But their match-fitness is always a cause of concern, more so in the year they toured India and England for gruelling Test matches.

Owing to a mixture of rest and injuries, Cummins has not played an ODI this year; Starc has not since the India tour and Hazlewood has looked far from his deceptive best in South Africa, his first 50-over assignment of this year, conceding eight runs an over in his last two games. Experienced as they could be, they need time to re-groove."

Heading into Week 3, the Power Rankings are still trying to figure out who is real and who is not. The top 10 shuffled a bit while the middle of the order is ... well, interesting. Time will tell if teams like the Atlanta Falcons and Washington Commanders will continue their hot streaks.

In addition to the updated power rankings, our 32 NFL Nation reporters identified a player with a current contract situation to monitor on every team. Some are playing this season on the last year of their deal, while others are expecting a contract extension in the near future. Let's check out the new 1-32 rankings below, starting with the San Francisco 49ers.

Week 2 ranking: 1

Player: WR Brandon Aiyuk

Current contract situation: Under contract through the 2024 season

The Niners picked up Aiyuk's fifth-year option in May. The only first-round pick the Niners have signed to a second contract in the Kyle Shanahan/John Lynch era (since 2017) is defensive end Nick Bosa, waiting until after his fourth season to do it. The Niners would like to make Aiyuk the second. The question is whether they can afford to keep both Aiyuk and Deebo Samuel long term. Much of that will depend on whether Aiyuk can build off last year's breakthrough season, in which he surpassed 1,000 receiving yards for the first time and led the team in receptions (78) while finishing second in touchdowns (eight). If he can, the cost to retain him will only increase. -- Nick Wagoner

Week 2 ranking: 4

Player: WR CeeDee Lamb

Current contract situation: Under contract through the 2024 season

The Cowboys picked up his fifth-year option for 2024 but would like to sign him to an extension sooner rather than later. The price to do so is only going to go up, and they will have Micah Parsons, Dak Prescott and some others to consider signing to extensions as well, which will stress their cap. Lamb has 15 catches for 220 yards in two games this season and is clearly Prescott's go-to guy. There are six receivers currently making at least $24 million a year, and for the Cowboys to get a deal done now, Lamb's yearly average will have to be more than that. Maybe a lot more. -- Todd Archer

Week 2 ranking: 2

Player: OLB Haason Reddick

Current contract situation: Under contract through the 2024 season

Reddick has quickly outplayed his three-year, $45 million contract, racking up 19.5 sacks in 2022, including the playoffs. His $15 million average salary per year is 15th among edge rushers, according to Roster Management Systems. ""Y'all see it, y'all know what's going on,"" said Reddick, when asked this offseason if he is underpaid. ""I'm worried about being the best version of myself, and then everything will sort itself out, truly."" -- Tim McManus

Week 2 ranking: 5

Player: QB Tua Tagovailoa

Current contract situation: Under contract through the 2024 season

There might not be a bigger contract situation to monitor in the NFL -- literally. After Joe Burrow reset the market on Day 1 of the 2023 season, Tagovailoa could do the same next spring. He will play on the fifth year of his rookie contract in 2024, but he's a betting favorite for NFL MVP through the first two weeks of this season, according to Caesars Sportsbook. If he keeps this up, expect the Dolphins to shell out more money than they've ever given a player in team history. -- Marcel Louis-Jacques

Week 2 ranking: 3

Player: DT Chris Jones

Current contract situation: Under contract through the 2023 season

Jones could be in his final season with the Chiefs. After holding out of training camp looking for a raise, Jones received incentives in a new contract that would allow him to earn more than the $19.5 million he was scheduled to make this season under his old contract, sources told ESPN. The sides were never close to an agreement on a long-term extension. Unless Jones is willing to accept less from the Chiefs to remain in Kansas City next year, it's difficult to picture them coming to an agreement. The franchise tag is a possibility but would probably be too pricey for the Chiefs. -- Adam Teicher

Week 2 ranking: 6

Player: LB Patrick Queen

Current contract situation: Under contract through the 2023 season

Queen is in the final year of his rookie deal ($2.268 million) and is scheduled to become a free agent in March after Baltimore declined his fifth-year option. He knows this season is essentially an audition for the other 31 teams in the league. His long-term future in Baltimore likely ended last year, when the Ravens traded for Roquan Smith and then made him the highest-paid middle linebacker. Early in his career, Queen struggled in coverage and missed tackles. Now, playing alongside Smith, Queen has become an all-around playmaker. Since 2020, Queen is one of three players to record more than 300 tackles, double-digit sacks and multiple interceptions. The others: Smith and Bobby Wagner. -- Jamison Hensley

Week 2 ranking: 9

Player: WR Gabe Davis

Current contract situation: Under contract through the 2023 season

Davis is playing on the final year of his rookie deal after the Bills drafted him in the fourth round of the 2020 draft. Davis suffered a high ankle sprain prior to Week 2 last season and finished with 48 catches for 836 yards and seven touchdowns but was often targeted on throws downfield and had nine drops. Davis is a strong run-blocker, was named a team captain for the first time in 2023 and has eight catches for 124 yards and a score so far this season. His future in Buffalo will depend on what he wants in a contract and if the Bills think he is the best option to pair with Stefon Diggs going forward. -- Alaina Getzenberg"

Why the Lions can cover

Detroit is known best for its robust offense, headlined by the connection between quarterback Jared Goff and receiver Amon-Ra St. Brown. The Lions are also playing well to open the season on defense, including a strong performance in Week 3. Detroit held the Atlanta Falcons to only six points last week, generating seven sacks and allowing fewer than three yards per play. Former No. 2 overall pick Aidan Hutchinson led the way with two sacks, a forced fumble, and a tackle for loss in the game, and that effort helped Detroit to boost its overall 2023 numbers.

The Lions are in the top six of the NFL in yards allowed per play (4.6), and opponents are scoring only 21.0 points per game against Detroit. The Lions are also above-average in total defense, yielding 297.3 yards per game, and Detroit has held opponents to a modest 35.9% third down conversion rate. Detroit is also playing at an elite level against the run, giving up only 72.0 rushing yards per game and 3.2 yards per carry. Green Bay's offense is generating only 90.3 rushing yards per contest, and Detroit is well-equipped to continue that ugly rushing trend. See which team to pick here.

Why the Packers can cover

Jordan Love is in the top five of the NFL in touchdown passes (seven), touchdown percentage (7.0%), and yards per completion (12.8) this season, and he is a true dual-threat option who keeps pressure on opposing defenses with his legs. Love has helped the Packers to top-10 marks in points per game (26.7) and points per drive (2.18), and Green Bay is near the top of the league in third down efficiency (46.5%) and red zone efficiency (77.8%). Ball security has been paramount for Green Bay with only turnover in three games, and Detroit has forced only two turnovers on defense.

The Packers are 14-4 in the last 18 home games, including 1-0 this season at Lambeau Field, and Green Bay has plenty of strengths on defense. The Packers are giving up fewer than five yards per play in 2023, a strongly above-average mark, and Green Bay has given up fewer than 600 passing yards in three games. Green Bay is a top-10 team in third down defense (31.0%) and red zone efficiency allowed (44.4%), and the Packers are facing a Lions team averaging only 3.6 yards per carry this season.

383,2023/09/23, 'college football scores',https://www.ncaa.com/news/football/article/2023-09-21/how-8-undefeated-week-4-games-could-shake-college-football-playoff-race,"While many of college football's juggernauts spent Week 3 fending off spirited fights from unranked foes, a loaded slate this weekend looks set to send playoff-altering shockwaves through the sport.

Six top 25 showdowns are on Saturday, and as the four-team playoff and its razor-thin margins creep closer, Week 4 already guarantees a cascade of quality wins and crushed postseason dreams.

Here's a look at all eight undefeated matchups Saturday ready to shake up the College Football Playoff picture — and what a win would mean for each program.

With just 250 miles between them and a shared blue-blood status since time immemorial, Ohio State and Notre Dame have shockingly played in South Bend just twice (1936 and 1996). Saturday's reunion offers the biggest showcase between the two perennial powers since, well, just last year actually, when No. 2 OSU outlasted No. 5 ND 21-10 from Ohio Stadium. Save for their iconic helmets and untouchable pedigree, however, these programs have come to look quite different in the 12 months since their last meeting.

Notre Dame, content to center their 2022 gameplan against OSU around ball control and field position, will now look to spotlight possibly the nation's deadliest 1-2 offensive punch. Tailback Audric Estime ranks third in FBS thus far with 8.3 yards per carry, an ascent from his 21-yard effort in Columbus last September, and has flourished partnered with Wake Forest transfer and all-time ACC touchdown leader Sam Hartman. Ohio State will spend its rare trip down Rte. 30 continuing to grapple with a wholly unfamiliar team dynamic. Quarterback play lingers as an unfamiliar point of concern in Columbus, with starter Kyle McCord managing fewer than 100 first half yards against Indiana, the team's lone Power 5 opponent thus far. Its recent middling defense, conversely, has been completely reshaped by DC Jim Knowles and currently ranks second in points allowed.

HISTORIC MEETING: OSU, Notre Dame enter historic form ahead of showdown

For Ohio State... A win would serve as a quality early notch on the Buckeye belt and a bit of much-needed insurance against the brutal Big Ten East gauntlet upcoming for the Buckeyes. Top-10 opponents Michigan and Penn State remain for Ohio State, and a win against the Irish Saturday would likely allow OSU to drop one of those remaining matchups and maintain a competitive shot at the CFP.

For Notre Dame... A win would be a massive statement of intent for a program stuck to the rear fringes of the CFP debate in the last couple of years. Ranked ninth in the AP Poll, beating the Buckeyes Saturday would surely advance ND near the top four spaces and into an advantageous position with top 25 matchups against Duke and USC still to come.

Long odds and skepticism have done nothing but grow Deion Sanders from a star to a supernova (sunglasses required, of course), but lingering doubts about the Buffaloes will produce immediate answers as they embark on possibly the stiffest conference gauntlet in America — just look at all those Pac-12 teams below! The nation's second-highest scoring offense awaits Coach Prime in Eugene on Saturday, with No. 10 Oregon battering overmatched opposition in Portland State and Hawai'i and rallying late to overcome Texas Tech in Lubbock.

Colorado's offense was similarly transcendent in shootout wins versus TCU, Nebraska and Colorado State, but a historic upset Saturday — Oregon has lost just once at Autzen Stadium since 2017 — relies on its less-celebrated defense. Despite a mixed defensive bag where the CU defensive front has often struggled to stop the run, Colorado ranks best in the country with 10 takeaways. Forcing Oregon's interception-free quarterback Bo Nix into a few mistakes will give the Buffaloes extra possessions and a fighting chance Saturday.

For Oregon... A win would inch them ever closer to the playoff places while crucially continuing to defend home turf with challenging road tilts against No. 8 Washington and No. 11 Utah upcoming.

For Colorado... A win would affirm Colorado's status as a very legitimate contender, not just for the Pac-12 but the Playoff picture as well, all while setting up an immense clash at Folsom Field next weekend against No. 5 USC.

POLLS: See the latest AP Top 25 rankings

While Rutgers has been consistently overmatched against most of the Big Ten's powers since joining the conference nearly 10 years ago, its experience against the Wolverines has ranged broadly from totally devastating to surprisingly competitive. The Scarlet Knights have sandwiched their memorable 78-0 loss to the Wolverines with strong showings — Rutgers picked up its first-ever conference win against Michigan 26-24 in 2014 and, since the return of coach Greg Schiano, has won three of its last six halves of football against Michigan.

To string together a complete game versus the Wolverines, Schiano will rely on Kyle Monangai to continue his excellent start to the season — the junior tailback has totaled nearly 400 yards and five touchdowns through three games — against the hallowed Michigan front. For Michigan, the focus will center around quarterback J.J. McCarthy, who bucked a nearly flawless start to the season in Week 3 with three interceptions against Bowling Green. If McCarthy can value the ball, an admittedly tougher task against a hawkish Rutgers secondary ranked fifth in scoring defense, Michigan can lean on its talent advantage in the trenches to hold off the Scarlet Knights.

For Michigan... A win Saturday would keep the Wolverines on track for postseason contention, likely needing to remain perfect through a manageable Big Ten slate before battling top-7 foes Penn State and Ohio State in the final three weeks of the season.

For Rutgers... Don't look now, but the Scarlet Knights sit undefeated with a pair of convincing wins against Power 5 foes Northwestern and Virginia Tech. An upset victory Saturday would likely improve Rutgers to 5-0, assuming RU takes care of business against Wagner, with an AP ranking to boot entering October.

Despite a perfect 3-0 start, Utah's start to the 2023 season has been characterized by familiar peaks and valleys. A dominant Week 1 win, which has only grown in value with Florida's return to the AP Poll, saw the Utes surge to a 24-3 lead over the Gators, but a less assuring performance the following Saturday saw Utah narrowly escape the clutches of a wounded Baylor team in Waco. Cam Rising's unknown injury status headlines a loaded injury list — 16 Utes won't play this weekend — as they hope to bounce back for their toughest test of the season so far.

UCLA's stellar performances against dangerous San Diego State and Coastal Carolina, paired with a 59-7 beatdown over NC Central, sees the Bruins edge Utah to 10th place in FBS scoring defense. This defensive improvement, in conjunction with coach Chip Kelly's patently dynamic offense, likely makes UCLA's 2023 squad the best of the Kelly era in Los Angeles. After forcing Grayson McCall into two interceptions and just a lone touchdown, even the return of Cam Rising will likely require another stellar afternoon for Utah to remain unbeaten Saturday.

For Utah... A win against fringe top-25 UCLA at home is essentially a must for a Utah team looking to keep up a pair of Rose Bowl appearances, given the amount of quality opposition remaining on the Utes' schedule.

For UCLA... A win would mark a premier win in Kelly's Tinseltown rebuild and likely position the Bruins inside the top-15 ahead of a dogged Pac-12 slate.

A fresh shade of orange and a cross-country trek has done wonders for Oregon State QB D.J Uiagalelei, who currently ranks 14th in FBS with an 87.1 quarterback rating after a pair of difficult seasons at Clemson. Uiagalelei's success has powered the Beavers to a dominant start, beating a triad of California schools by at least three scores and matching their highest AP ranking in over a decade. The Beavers' relatively easy start to the schedule ramps up drastically on Saturday, traveling to Pullman and facing a Washington State team that has certainly exceeded its middle-of-the-pack expectations through three games.

The Cougars battered Colorado State 50-22 in Colorado Springs, the same Rams team that pushed Prime's Buffaloes to double overtime, before derailing the Tanner Mordecai hype train with a suffocating and ultimately insurmountable 24-6 halftime lead. For its first game inside the AP Top 25 since 2019, Wazzou will expect a traditional West Coast shootout Saturday, with the teams each sporting a top-15 quarterback per QBR and collectively surpassing 26 points in all six games thus far.

For Oregon State... A win gives Oregon State a quality win to pair with sizable preseason hype and an acclaimed quarterback, all encouraging signs toward an outside playoff push.

For Washington State... A win makes Wazzou's relatively manageable Pac-12 slate — the Cougars avoid both No. 5 USC and No. 11 Utah — a golden ticket toward an increasingly possible run at the conference championship.

Penn State quarterback Drew Allar's surging stock took a dip in Champaign last weekend, as despite a convincing 30-13 victory, the sophomore quarterback managed zero touchdowns and completed fewer than 50 percent of his passes. The Big Ten offers nary a better test for concerning quarterback play than the Iowa Hawkeyes, who have consistently enjoyed one of the nation's best defenses in Kirk Ferentz's tenure.

It's been offensively where the Hawkeyes have struggled in recent years, and despite a disconcerting 22-point scoring average through opening games against Utah State and Iowa State, improved quarterback play from Michigan transfer Cade McNamara and a 41-point outburst against Western Michigan has fueled quiet optimism around Iowa City. A night game at Beaver Stadium mandates more than belief, however, and continued growth from McNamara will be needed for Iowa to pull off a shocker in State College Saturday, especially with the Hawkeyes dealing with injuries.

For Penn State... A win over Iowa constitutes ""taking care of business"" for an ambitious Nittany Lion program. Red ink encircles October 21, when PSU travels to No. 6 Ohio State, and entering Columbus undefeated is paramount for its national championship dreams.

For Iowa... A win over Penn State sparks a suddenly compelling second half to the season and a potential dilemma for the selection committee — the Hawkeyes have no more ranked teams on their schedule following Saturday and could very feasibly win each remaining game.

How's this for a matchup of Big 12 unbeatens! Kansas, new to the upper reaches of the conference table, and BYU, new to the conference entirely, seem set for a thrilling, high-scoring affair in Lawrence. KU took the 2022 Big Ten West runner-ups to school in Week 2, as over 300 all-purpose yards from quarterback Jalon Daniels powered Kansas to a dominant 34-7 lead and ultimately a two-score victory. BYU enjoyed a similarly emphatic offensive showing to beat Arkansas in much more contentious fashion last Saturday, snuffing out a last-second lateral attempt to escape from Fayetteville 38-31 victors.

All eyes are under center for Saturday's matchup, with Daniels and Arkansas quarterback K.J. Jefferson separating themselves as fringe Heisman contenders and the unquestioned engines for a pair of high-powered offenses.

For Kansas... A win Saturday would almost certainly vault the Jayhawks back into the top 25, marking the would-be first time KU has been ranked in the AP Poll in consecutive seasons since 2009.

For BYU... A win Saturday gives the Cougars their first-ever Big 12 win and sets up a conference slate that looks pretty favorably — BYU avoids both 3-0 UCF and recently ranked Kansas State.

The Memphis Tigers escaped against Navy last week and are quietly 3-0. The Missouri Tigers had some late drama last week, toppling former conference rival and then-No. 15 Kansas State on Harrison Mevis' 61-yard field goal. Now, can Mizzou keep on winning, with more attention focused on the undefeated squad? Missouri QB Brady Cook passed for 356 yards and has still not thrown an interception this season. He'll have to be solid again.

For Memphis... A win would make the Tigers a top Group of Five contender for one of the New Year's Six bowls — again. The Tigers made the Cotton Bowl in the 2019 season.

For Missouri... A win should move the Tigers into the AP Top 25, as they're the second team out in the latest poll. However, Missouri's schedule won't slow down. After Vanderbilt to close September, the Tigers get four teams currently ranked in their last seven games — including No. 1 Georgia."

386,2023/09/23, 'nic kerdiles',https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/24/us/nic-kerdiles-hockey-death/index.html,"CNN —

Nic Kerdiles, a former hockey player who was engaged to the reality TV star Savannah Chrisley, was killed in a motorcycle crash in Nashville early Saturday morning, police said.

Kerdiles, 29, was driving a motorcycle when he collided with an SUV at the intersection of 14th Avenue North and Wheless Street, Nashville Police said in a statement to CNN affiliate WSMV.

The preliminary investigation showed he traveled through a stop sign and struck the driver’s side of a BMW, police said. The SUV driver stopped immediately, and there were no signs of impairment for either driver, police said. No charges are anticipated, police said.

Kerdiles was taken to Vanderbilt University Medical Center but died of the injuries.

Kerdiles was drafted by the Anaheim Ducks in the 2nd round of the 2012 NHL Draft. A left wing, he played in a total of just three games with the Ducks in the 2016-2017 season and the 2017-2018 season.

The Ducks shared their condolences in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.

“We’re heartbroken to hear the news about Nic Kerdiles, who died in a motorcycle accident this morning. An Irvine native, Nic became the first player from Orange County to play for the Ducks, in 2017,” the team said. “Our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to his family and loved ones.”

Kerdiles also made several appearances in the USA Network reality shows “Chrisley Knows Best” and “Growing Up Chrisley,” which followed the Atlanta real estate moguls Todd and Julie Chrisley and their children.

In a 2019 episode, Kerdiles proposed to Savannah Chrisley in front of her family. They called off the engagement just over a year later but remained close. In a 2022 episode, the two decided to try to make their relationship work, and he acknowledged the end of his hockey career was an issue in their relationship.

“A career change for me was huge,” he said. “Hockey was my entire life, and so when I had to retire, I can admit that I didn’t handle it the best way.”

Chrisley posted to her Instagram story Saturday a photo of the two holding hands on the beach.

“Heaven gained the most beautiful angel today … I miss you and I love you… I’ll forever save our last messages of ‘I love you’ … please send me a sign that you’re ok… maybe it’ll be thru a ham and cheese crepe.. or pasta with white sauce… or maybe even your favorite carrot cake,” she wrote.

“We loved hard… and I can’t wait to ride bikes along the beaches of heaven with you one day.”

In 2021, 5,932 motorcyclists were killed in crashes, an 8% increase from the year before and the highest number of deaths since data collection began in 1975, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration.

Motorcycles make up about 3% of all registered vehicles and 0.6% of vehicle miles traveled in the US, but motorcyclists account for 14% of all traffic deaths, according to the National Safety Council."

Holtz told ""The Pat McAfee Show"" before Saturday's game that Ohio State had not been physical enough to beat premier opponents, citing the team's consecutive losses to Michigan and its CFP defeats against Georgia, Alabama and Clemson.

""I don't feel bad about saying it because I believed it,"" Holtz told Dakich. ""Notre Dame was a better football team. Three times, Ohio State had fourth-and-1, ran the ball and couldn't make it. ... If I was coaching, I would have said it. I would [have] went to our team and said, 'I think you're better. I think you're more physical. I think you're more talented.'

""But when I say something and yet I can't control the outcome of the game, that's unfair to Coach Freeman.""

An emotional Day cited Holtz's comments in his on-field interview with NBC after the Buckeyes' win and then again in his postgame news conference, saying that Holtz and others who questioned Ohio State's toughness and physicality need to ""put the film on.""

""We always say, 'Ignore the noise,' but every once in a while, after a while someone's poking at you, you've got to stand up for what you believe in,"" Day said. ""To see some of the things that were said, I get Ohio against the world, but we needed to go play like that today. We needed to win like that, to stop that narrative that's going on, because it's not true.""

Holtz, 86, said he understands why Day was unhappy with him.

""He doesn't want to talk about [losing to] Michigan, 0-2, he doesn't want to talk about the big games coming up against Penn State and against Michigan again,"" Holtz said. ""He's a great coach. He's done a tremendous job. He's a great offensive mind. ... Ohio State's a good football team. I don't think they're a great football team. He can go after me all he wants.""

Holtz added that he hopes Day ""goes on and has a wonderful year,"" while adding that Notre Dame's mistakes in the final two minutes, including not forcing Ohio State to use all its timeouts before the Buckeyes' final possession, likely cost the Irish a win he thought they deserved. He also said he didn't realize how much his comments would be amplified.

""Coach Freeman is always a class guy,"" Holtz said. ""He's very, very polite. He didn't even make a comment about it, but I wanted him to know that I felt bad."""
388,2023/09/24, 'cowboys vs cardinals',https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/news/cowboys-vs-cardinals-prediction-odds-spread-line-start-time-2023-nfl-picks-week-3-bets-by-proven-model/,"The Arizona Cardinals have been more competitive than expected through their first two games, but blowing a 20-0 halftime lead against the Giants last week might have shaken their confidence going forward. On Sunday, they host arguably the most dominant team through the first two weeks of the 2023 season, the Dallas Cowboys. Arizona (0-2) fell 31-28 last week, while Dallas (2-0) has outscored both New York teams a combined 70-10 en route to blowout wins. The teams last met in January 2022, a 25-22 Arizona victory on the road.

Kickoff from State Farm Stadium in Glendale is scheduled for 4:25 p.m. ET. Dallas is listed as a 13-point road favorite and the over/under for total points scored is 43 in the latest Cowboys vs. Cardinals odds. Before making any Cowboys vs. Cardinals picks, you need to see the NFL predictions and betting advice from the computer simulation model at SportsLine.

The model, which simulates every NFL game 10,000 times, is up more than $7,000 for $100 players on top-rated NFL picks since its inception. The model enters Week 3 of the 2023 NFL season on an incredible 164-117 run on top-rated NFL picks that dates back to the 2017 season.

Why the Cowboys can cover

The 2023 season looked to be off to a perfect start for Dallas until an injury by top cornerback Trevon Diggs in Thursday's practice will sideline him for the rest of the season. The Cowboys' defense has stifled Daniel Jones and Zach Wilson thus far and should continue to be elite led by Micah Parsons, but Diggs' loss still leaves a void. Parsons, the favorite for 2023 NFL Defensive Player of the Year, recorded three tackles for a loss and two sacks last Sunday against the Jets.

Dallas' offense has been equally as productive thus far led by quarterback Dak Prescott, who completed 31 of 38 passes for 255 yards and two scores. His main target, wide receiver Cee Dee Lamb, caught a game-high 11 passes for 143 yards, though both touchdowns went to tight ends: Jake Ferguson and Luke Schoonmaker. Running back Tony Pollard rushed 25 times for 79 yards and caught seven passes for 37 yards. It will be an uphill battle for Arizona to slow down Dallas' potent offense this weekend. See which team to pick here.

Why the Cardinals can cover

To say the Cardinals looked dominant in the first half against the Giants would be an understatement. Arizona led 20-0 at halftime and looked to be fully in control heading towards their first win of 2023. But a 31-8 second half capped off by a Graham Gano field goal as time expired pushed Arizona to its second defeat and 14th in their last 15 games at State Farm Stadium. Arizona has now lost nine straight games dating back to last season, the second-longest streak in the league behind the Bears.

James Conner rushed for 106 yards and a score but did most of his damage before halftime, while new quarterback Joshua Dobbs threw for 228 yards and a score in the defeat. Arizona had three pass catchers top the 50-yard mark on Sunday: rookie Michael Wilson (3-56-0), tight end Zach Ertz (6-56-0), and top wide receiver Marquise Brown (6-54-1). Arizona did not allow a sack nor commit a turnover, which seems like a formula that needs to be repeated in order to stay in the game with Dallas on Sunday. See which team to pick here.

All told, he had 121 yards on the aforementioned 32 carries for an average of 3.8 yards per carry. The latter is hardly a celebratory statistic, but he was able to ground and pound the Packers, helping to propel Detroit to a 27-0 run in the first half before quelling any comeback hopes with a score with six minutes to go. According to Next Gen Stats, Montgomery battered and bruised the Packers with 113 yards after contact -- the most in a single game in his career.

""He does get better throughout the game,"" Lions quarterback Jared Goff said. ""He gets better the more he gets hit. The more that he's able to see the holes and see what's going on -- and yeah, he did get better. I think there was two types of runs like where the lane was wide open, and he was running right through them doing his thing. Then, there was runs where there wasn't much there and he kind of made something out of nothing. That's when you know your guy is in the zone a little bit. You try to keep feeding him and he did his thing tonight."""

KANSAS CITY (2-1) at NEW YORK JETS (1-2)

Sunday, 8:20 p.m. EDT, NBC

OPENING LINE: Chiefs by 9 1/2, according to FanDuel SportsBook.

AGAINST THE SPREAD: Chiefs 2-1; Jets 1-2.

SERIES RECORD: Chiefs lead 20-19-1.

NFL STATS CENTRAL: The latest NFL scores, schedules, odds, stats and more.

LAST MEETING: Chiefs beat Jets 35-9 on Nov. 1, 2020, in Kansas City, Missouri.

LAST WEEK: Chiefs beat Bears 41-10; Jets lost to Patriots 15-10.

CHIEFS OFFENSE: OVERALL (5), RUSH (10), PASS (5), SCORING (9).

CHIEFS DEFENSE: OVERALL (6), RUSH (11), PASS (6), SCORING (4).

JETS OFFENSE: OVERALL (32), RUSH (22), PASS (32), SCORING (32)

JETS DEFENSE: OVERALL (20), RUSH (23), PASS (16), SCORING (12)

TURNOVER DIFFERENTIAL: Chiefs minus-2; Jets minus-1.

CHIEFS PLAYER TO WATCH: TE Travis Kelce. Taylor Swift is watching him, so why shouldn’t everyone else? He has 71 touchdown receptions, which is five behind Pro Football Hall of Fame tight end Tony Gonzalez for the franchise record. Kelce and Patrick Mahomes have connected 48 times for touchdowns, including once last week against Chicago. Three more and they will tie Drew Brees and Jimmy Graham for the third most for a QB-TE combo in NFL history.

JETS PLAYER TO WATCH: QB Zach Wilson. It has gotten ugly (again) for the 2021 No. 2 overall draft pick. Struggling in place of the injured Aaron Rodgers, Wilson has drawn ire of frustrated fans — including Hall of Famer Joe Namath — who are clamoring for a quarterback change. New York signed veteran Trevor Siemian to its practice squad and he'll be inactive this week. But if Wilson can't improve on his production in a hurry, fans will be clamoring for Siemian moving forward.

KEY MATCHUP: Chiefs O-line vs. Jets D-line. Mahomes has been getting excellent blocking in front of him, having been pressured on only 25.4% of his drop-backs this season — which is a career low. Center Creed Humphrey and left guard Joe Thuney allowed no pressures on their 41 pass-blocking snaps against Chicago. The Jets were expected to have a strong pass rush this season and are putting pressure on quarterbacks, but have just six sacks through three games and Quinnen Williams is looking for his first after a career-high 12 last season.

KEY INJURIES: Mahomes tweaked his ankle last week against Chicago, but should be fine. ... DT Chris Jones was limited early in the week with a groin ailment. ... LB Nick Bolton didn't practice early in the week with a sprained ankle. ... Jets S Tony Adams (hamstring) and backup OL Wes Schweitzer (concussion) missed last week's game and didn't practice at the start of this week.

SERIES NOTES: The Chiefs have won three of the past four meetings. ... The teams have met twice in the postseason: a win by the Chiefs in the 1969 divisional round; and a victory by the Jets in the 1986 wild-card round. ... The Jets are 12-8-1 at home — including the two postseason matchups — against the Chiefs. ... Kansas City is looking to snap a four-game road skid against the Jets.

STATS AND STUFF: The game marks the first for Mahomes at MetLife Stadium. ... Andy Reid is 3-1 as coach of the Chiefs against the Jets, including 1-0 with Mahomes as his quarterback. ... The Jets are playing on Sunday night for the first time since losing 37-16 to New England in Week 10 of the 2011 season. ... Reid won his 271st game last week, passing Tom Landry for fourth on the NFL's career list. ... Mahomes needs 23 yards rushing to break the Chiefs’ career mark for a quarterback held by Alex Smith (1,672). ... Mahomes has 199 TD passes. He could reach 200 in his 84th game Sunday night, five faster than Dan Marino’s NFL record. ... Mahomes surpassed 25,000 yards passing last week against the Bears. He did it in 83 games, seven faster than Matthew Stafford’s record. ... Chiefs RB Jerick McKinnon had two TD receptions last week against the Bears. He has 11 TD catches in 33 games for Kansas City, the fourth most by a running back in club history. ... Kelce has caught a pass in 145 consecutive games, five shy of Hall of Famer Ozzie Newsome for the second-longest streak among tight ends. ... Humphrey is expected to start his 37th straight game since he was drafted. That’s the fifth-longest streak to start a career in club history. ... Kansas City allowed 203 yards last week against Chicago. It was the fifth-fewest yards since Reid took over before the 2013 season. ... Jones has 2 1/2 sacks in the two games since ending his holdout. ... The Jets went 1 for 10 on third down against Dallas in Week 2 and 2 for 14 last Sunday against New England. For the season, they’re 8 for 37 with a 22% conversion rate ranking last in the NFL. ... New York had just 12 first downs and averaged a measly 2.8 yards per play in the loss to the Patriots. ... Wilson's 57.0 quarterback rating ranks last in the NFL. Last season, he became the first player since the 1970 merger to finish last in that category two years in a row, and is on pace for a third straight. ... RB Breece Hall set the franchise record for the most yards per carry through a player’s first 10 games (minimum 50 carries) with 5.8. The previous best was Al Dorow in 1960, when he averaged 5.56 yards per carry for the then-NY Titans. ... WR Garrett Wilson has 1,268 yards receiving in 20 games, the fewest to reach 1,200 yards receiving in Jets history. ... FB Nick Bawden scored his first NFL touchdown on his first NFL carry last week. Bawden, who switched from QB to FB at San Diego State, has five catches in 22 games — but his 1-yard TD was the first time he carried the ball on a run. ... LG Laken Tomlinson made his 100th consecutive regular-season start last Sunday. The streak began in Week 2 of the 2017 season. He’s one of five active players with at least 100 straight starts. ... Former Jets star DL Joe Klecko will receive his Pro Football Hall of Fame Ring of Excellence during a halftime ceremony. Klecko will also serve as the Jets’ honorary captain.

FANTASY TIP: Chiefs RB Isiah Pacheco had a season-high 78 yards from scrimmage last week and has led Kansas City's backfield in touches in each of the first three games. He could see increased carries if this one gets out of hand in the Chiefs' favor early.

Jordan Love has Green Bay off to a 1-1 start, and he's been everything the team could have hoped for as he leads the NFL in passing touchdowns and passer rating. Meanwhile, the Saints are off to a 2-0 start behind Derek Carr after he spent nine years with the Raiders. Both teams' backfields could be shorthanded as New Orleans will be without Alvin Kamara (suspended) and Jamaal Williams (hamstring), while Packers RB Aaron Jones (hamstring) is questionable after missing Week 2.

Kickoff is scheduled for 1 p.m. ET at Lambeau Field. Green Bay is favored by 1 point in the latest Saints vs. Packers odds, and the over/under for total points scored is 42.5.

Why the Saints can cover

The Derek Carr era has gotten off to a hot start in New Orleans. The 32-year-old veteran hasn't been particularly sharp through two games, but he has been efficient enough for New Orleans to win both of its games. Chris Olave (14 catches, 198 yards), Michael Thomas (12 catches, 116 yards), and Rashid Shaheed (9 catches, 152 yards, 1 TD) give the Saints one of the most talented wide receiver trios in the NFL.

The main reason for the Saints' early season success has been their play on the defensive side of the ball. New Orleans has allowed 277.5 total yards (175.5 passing, 102 rushing) and 16 points per game. New Orleans is facing a banged up Green Bay offense dealing with injuries to David Bakhtiari (knee, questionable), Aaron Jones (hamstring, questionable) and Christian Watson (hamstring, questionable). See which team to pick here.

Why the Packers can cover

Green Bay lost straight-up to Atlanta last week, but it has a tendency to bounce back following losses under coach Matt LaFleur. Since he took over in 2019, the Packers are 13-4 against the spread following a straight-up loss. Additionally, Green Bay is 12-3 ATS in September under LaFleur, which is the best against-the-spread record in the NFL over that span.

The Saints enter this matchup shorthanded, not just with the aforementioned RB absences, but safety Marcus Maye was suspended three games earlier this week. He's one of just five players with a sack and interception this season as New Orleans had the league's No. 5 defense with him in the lineup. There is sure to be some dropoff without him, and the Saints' offense isn't built to pick up the slack. The team ranks 25th in scoring, 29th in red zone offense and has committed as many turnovers as it has touchdowns scored. See which team to pick here.

392,2023/09/24, 'dolphins',https://www.espn.co.uk/blog/miami-dolphins/post/_/id/34486/dolphins-make-history-with-70-points-726-yards-and-bills-on-deck,"MIAMI -- The video boards at Hard Rock Stadium remained illuminated for roughly 90 minutes after the Miami Dolphins’ win Sunday over the Denver Broncos -- as if to prove the final score was not a mirage.

Dolphins' historical outburst Here are some of the historic milestones Miami reached in in its 70-20 over Denver on Sunday. NFL Rank Category 1st 70 points, 700 yards 1st 5 passing/rushing TDs 2nd 300 passing/rushing yards 2nd 130 points through 3 games 2nd Achane/Mostert with 4 TDs T-2 10 touchdowns 4th 70 points Source: ESPN Stats & Info

The Dolphins set a franchise record for points in a single game in the 70-20 drubbing, becoming the first team in NFL history to score 70 points and compile 700 yards of offense in the same game.

For perspective, there are two teams -- the New York Jets (675) and the Tennessee Titans (720) -- who have fewer yards of offense in three games combined than the Dolphins had in Week 3 (726).

But the Dolphins don’t have much time to admire their stats. Miami will face its biggest litmus test of the season when it travels to the Buffalo Bills on Sunday (1 p.m., E.T., CBS) to face a defense that just recorded seven sacks, four interceptions, a fumble recovery and a defensive touchdown in a 37-3 rout of the Washington Commanders.

With the AFC East showdown on deck, here are three major takeaways from the Dolphins’ incredible day, with a look ahead to next week:

Tua’s ‘night and day’ difference

Dolphins quarterback Tua Tagovailoa completed his first 17 passes of the game, finishing 23-of-26 for 309 yards and four touchdowns. He ranks second in the NFL in passing yards (1,024), passing touchdowns (8) and QBR (77.7) and averages the fourth-most air yards per pass attempt (7.6).

And to think, as a rookie three years ago, Tagovailoa was benched in the fourth quarter against Denver for Ryan Fitzpatrick. Dolphins linebacker Bradley Chubb, who played on that Broncos team in 2020, has noticed the growth in Tagovailoa’s game.

“Man since then? That s— is night and day, to be honest with you,” Chubb said. “Just how he carries himself, the confidence he has walking on the field, just every little detail about him.

“I feel like in 2020, we knew if Tua was in the game we [the Broncos] probably had a good chance of winning -- which is crazy, but it's true. … I mean in 2020 that was the case. Today? F— no.”

Tagovailoa’s completion percentage over expectation on Sunday was +14.3%, his second-best single-game CPOE as a starter.

Looking ahead to the Bills: In five career games against Buffalo, Tagovailoa has completed just 87-of-149 passes for 999 yards, four touchdowns and four interceptions. He’s been injured to some extent during four of those games.

Buffalo’s defense made a statement Sunday and is third in total yards allowed per game (253), passing yards per game (142.3) and points per game 11.7.

A clean pocket

There were fans in the stands whose jerseys were dirtier than Tagovailoa’s on Sunday, thanks in large part to the speed with which he got rid of the ball – just 2.29 seconds – and the protection of his offensive line.

Tagovailoa was pressured just three times in 26 dropbacks and was hit once.

Miami’s offensive line has allowed one sack in three games and got its best player back from injury with the return of Pro Bowl left tackle Terron Armstead.

Looking ahead to the Bills: The Dolphins’ offensive line faces a tough assignment against a Bills defense that’s won 56.5% of its pass rushes -- the third-best mark in the NFL. After their seven-sack outburst against Washington, the Bills are tied for the league lead with 12 sacks to start the season.

One of the best counters to an elite pass rush is a strong run game. Luckily for the Dolphins, they turned in one of the most memorable ground performances in NFL history.

No move was right move at RB

Dolphins running back Raheem Mostert heard all the Dalvin Cook and Jonathan Taylor rumors this offseason. He’s responded with a league-leading six rushing touchdowns through three games.

He was dangerous and versatile against the Broncos, rushing for 82 yards and three touchdowns on 13 carries, adding 60 more yards and a touchdown on seven catches.

Not to be outdone, rookie De’Von Achane compiled 233 total yards and four touchdowns, including 203 rushing yards and two scores on 18 carries.

The tandem owns three of the six-fastest ball carrier speeds this season -- Achane set the second-fastest speed Sunday, hitting 21.93 miles per hour on his 67-yard touchdown run.

Miami rushed for 350 yards Sunday.

“We put a lot of that on the O-line. A lot of that run game weight is on our shoulders,” Armstead said. “We try to create lanes and get those guys into the third level. That’s the goal, and it’s on them to make the safeties miss and the corners miss.

“But that again is not just a running back stat. Receivers have to block on the edge… It’s everybody. It’s a full offensive statistic, so everything that we’re doing from sacks, rushing, passing. All 11.”

Looking ahead to the Bills: The Bills’ defense has been mediocre against the run, ranking 16th in rushing yards allowed per game (110.7), and Mostert has experienced some success against them in the past. He ran for 136 yards on 17 carries in Miami’s 32-29 regular-season loss in Buffalo last season, but he missed the teams’ wild-card matchup."
393,2023/09/24, 'derek carr',https://www.nfl.com/news/saints-derek-carr-confident-in-backup-jameis-winston-he-s-a-starter-in-this-leag,"It sounds as if that time has not yet arrived -- Carr was a DNP on Wednesday. New Orleans will proceed with Winston as its starter for the time being, about which Carr feels confident.

""From what I got to watch; he did a great job,"" Carr said of Winston's performance against the Packers.

""Jameis is a starter in this league. We have a couple guys that can start NFL football games in our room and Jameis is another one of those guys. Jameis came in -- in practice I take every rep -- and he did a great job of stepping in with no reps and playing good football. As he knows, in that role no matter where you're at, when you're called upon that's the expectation. I thought he did a great job for what he was asked to do, absolutely.""

Winston wasn't spectacular in relief of Carr, but did post a solid stat line (10 of 16, 101 passing yards). Unfortunately for both Winston and the Saints, the first five New Orleans possessions with Winston in the lineup resulted in punts, and the final possession ended in the disappointment of a missed field goal, sealing the comeback win for the Packers.

Even if the Saints struggled in the second half with him taking snaps, Winston remains New Orleans' best option if Carr can't play. Arguing otherwise (and in favor of Hill) would require willfully ignoring Hill's last serious outing as a starter: a two-touchdown, two-turnover performance that produced a stunning loss to an underdog Eagles team in 2020 that effectively ended Hill's run as a viable starter for New Orleans."
394,2023/09/25, 'david mccallum',https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/david-mccallum-dead-ncis-man-from-uncle-1235734772/,"David McCallum, who starred as Illya Kuryakin alongside Robert Vaughn’s Napoleon Solo in the 1960s hit spy drama “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” and had a supporting role as pathologist Dr. Donald “Ducky” Mallard on the top-rated series “NCIS” decades later, died Monday of natural causes in New York City. He was 90.

His son Peter made a statement on behalf of his family, saying, “He was the kindest, coolest, most patient and loving father. He always put family before self. He looked forward to any chance to connect with his grandchildren, and had a unique bond with each of them. He and his youngest grandson, Whit, 9, could often be found in the corner of a room at family parties having deep philosophical conversations.

“He was a true renaissance man — he was fascinated by science and culture and would turn those passions into knowledge. For example, he was capable of conducting a symphony orchestra and (if needed) could actually perform an autopsy, based on his decades-long studies for his role on NCIS.

“After returning from the hospital to their apartment, I asked my mother if she was OK before she went to sleep. Her answer was simply, “Yes. But I do wish we had had a chance to grow old together.” She is 79, and dad just turned 90. The honesty in that emotion shows how vibrant their beautiful relationship and daily lives were, and that somehow, even at 90, Daddy never grew old.”

The James Bond-influenced “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.,” in which Vaughn’s Solo and McCallum’s Kuryakin battled the evil forces of THRUSH around the globe (thanks to the glories of stock footage), was quite the pop-culture phenomenon in the mid-1960s, even as the show’s tone wavered from fairly serious to cartoonish and back again over its four seasons. It spawned a spinoff, “The Girl From U.N.C.L.E.,” starring Stefanie Powers, as well as a few feature adaptations during the run of the TV series, “One Spy Too Many,” “One of Our Spies Is Missing” and “The Karate Killers,” that starred Vaughn and McCallum.

McCallum also guested as Kuryakin on sitcom “Please Don’t Eat the Daisies”; he reprised the role in 1983 for TV movie “The Return of the Man from U.N.C.L.E.: The Fifteen Years Later Affair.”

In an appreciation of “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” series in the Boston Globe in 2008, Mark Feeney wrote, “Where Vaughn’s Solo was chilly, McCallum’s Kuryakin was cool — very cool indeed. If Julie Christie had the ’60s’ sexiest lower lip, as she most certainly did, then McCallum was a distant second. Add in his blond bangs, high cerebral forehead, and penchant for dark turtlenecks, and a teen idol was born.”

A Guy Ritchie-directed feature adaptation of “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.” was released in August 2015 with Henry Cavill and Armie Hammer starring as Solo and Kuryakin, respectively.

On CBS’ smash “NCIS,” centering on a team of agents from the Naval Criminal Investigative Service led by Mark Harmon’s Leroy Jethro Gibbs, McCallum’s Dr. Mallard offered not only key forensic clues but also served as a criminal profiler. Mallard had a wacky, ancient mother who eventually developed dementia and later died, and McCallum was key to the series’ successful blend of drama leavened with comedy. The series, which debuted in 2003, spawned two spinoffs, “NCIS: Los Angeles” and “NCIS: New Orleans.”

CBS said in a statement, “We are deeply saddened by the passing of David McCallum and privileged that CBS was his home for so many years. David was a gifted actor and author, and beloved by many around the world. He led an incredible life, and his legacy will forever live on through his family and the countless hours on film and television that will never go away. We will miss his warmth and endearing sense of humor that lit up any room or soundstage he stepped onto, as well as the brilliant stories he often shared from a life well-lived. Our hearts go out to his wife Katherine and his entire family, and all those who knew and loved David.”

“NCIS” was voted America’s favorite television show in a 2011 Harris Poll, and it was the most-watched series in the U.S. during the 2012-13 TV season.

In a 2012 interview, he explained to Variety‘s Chris Willman why he was still working after six decades in the business, “I’m doing it because I absolutely love what I’m doing. I’m doing what I was born to do. And I’ve done it when I joined Equity in 1946. And it’s wonderful to have this show and this character at this point in my career.”

“My life is dedicated to the new script coming through the door,” he continued, “Making sure that all the pathology is right, and then finding out how many words I have to learn for Ducky, which then translates into how many hours I have to do to work to get it in my head and get it as best we can. It sometimes seems you go in, you have a couple of lines, and Pauley talks all the time. Or other times you go into a scene and you have three pages of detailed medical jargon, and I have to work really hard to get that and make it sound glib and make it sound as if I know what I’m doing.”

Though he was busy with “NCIS,” McCallum had developed something of a second career as a voice actor on Toon Disney show “The Replacements,” in which he performed C.A.R.; various iterations of the “Ben 10” series as Professor Paradox; and in videogames such as “Diablo III: Reaper of Souls.”

David Keith McCallum was born in Glasgow, Scotland, to a father who was first violinist for the London Philharmonic and a mother who was a cellist. Thus he originally pursued a career in music, training on the oboe and studying for a time at the Royal Academy of Music, though he soon left and enrolled at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. After RADA he started performing with repertory theater companies.

But he had actually begun his professional acting career when he was 12, in 1946, performing for the BBC radio repertory company.

He made his screen debut in the BBC fantasy miniseries “The Rose and the Ring” in 1953.

The young actor appeared in the bigscreen crime dramas “The Secret Place,” “Hell Drivers” and “Violent Playground” in the late ’50s along with the Australian Western “Robbery Under Arms,” starring Peter Finch.

In the 1958 film “A Night to Remember,” about the Titanic, he had a small role as a wireless operator.

He did a lot of British television at this stage in his career, including a 1959 BBC adaptation of Jean Anouilh’s “Antigone” and BBC adaptations of Jane Austen’s “Emma” in 1960 and “Wuthering Heights” in 1962.

In 1961 he appeared in the stark, claustrophobic British-made WWII film “The Long and the Short and the Tall” (aka “Jungle Fighters”) along with Richard Harris, Richard Todd and Laurence Harvey, and he had supporting roles in Peter Ustinov’s “Billy Budd” and John Huston’s “Freud” the following year.

In 1963 McCallum had the good fortune to be cast in the high-profile, monumentally successful American-made film “The Great Escape,” starring Steve McQueen and a host of others. McCallum was a key supporting player as a member of the team nicknamed “Dispersal,” and though his performance is not the first thing one remembers from the film, it allowed him to break through. In George Stevens’ 1964 Christ epic “The Greatest Story Every Told,” starring Max Von Sydow, McCallum played Judas, further boosting his profile — the New York Times said, “David McCallum’s Judas Iscariot oozes a chilling treachery.”

The actor guested on American TV shows including “Perry Mason” and “The Outer Limits” just as he began his run on “The Man From U.N.C.L.E.”

McCallum starred in the critically acclaimed BBC-Universal Television series “Colditz,” which ran from 1972-74 and followed the lives of British prisoners held in castle by the Nazis during WWII. In 1975 he starred in the NBC sci-fi drama “The Invisible Man,” but it lasted only a season. He starred in a critically hailed miniseries adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson’s “Kidnapped” for Britain’s ITV, and starred opposite Joanna Lumley in the ITV sci-fi series “Sapphire & Steel,” which ran for six seasons beginning in 1979.

He reunited with Robert Vaughn, who was a series regular on the last season of NBC’s “The A-Team,” for an episode of that series called “The Say Uncle Affair” in 1986.

McCallum guested on “The Father Dowling Mysteries,” “Murder, She Wrote,” “SeaQuest 2032,” “Babylon 5,” “Law & Order” and even “Sex and the City,” and the actor had a small role in the charming British-Irish film “Hear My Song” (1991); on the BBC during this time he was a series regular on “Trainer.” In the U.S. he recurred on Fox’s ahead-of-its-time cyber-thriller “VR.5,” starring Lori Singer, in 1995-97, and on the Richard Dreyfuss vehicle “The Education of Max Bickford” in 2001.

When he guested on “JAG” in 2003, at the age of 70, in the backdoor pilot for “NCIS,” McCallum had no idea that he was about to fill his dance card for the next decade-plus.

At the height of his fame in the 1960s, McCallum recorded four albums for Capitol Records. These were not opportunities for him to sing; instead, the classically trained musician conceived a blend of oboe, English horn, and strings with guitar and drums, presenting instrumental interpretations of current hits. Though someone else was officially credited as the arranger on the albums, McCallum conducted the music and contributed several original compositions.

In 2016 McCallum’s mystery novel “Once a Crooked Man” was published.

McCallum was twice married, the first time to actress Jill Ireland.

He is survived by his wife of 56 years, Katherine McCallum, his sons Paul McCallum, Valentine McCallum and Peter McCallum, his daughter Sophie McCallum and his eight grandchildren: Julia McCallum, Luca de Sanctis, Iain de Sanctis, Stella McCallum, Gavin McCallum, George McCallum, Alessandro de Sanctis and Whit McCallum.

Week 3 in the NFL wrapped up with the Philadelphia Eagles moving to 3-0 with a thorough defeat of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Meanwhile, the Cincinnati Bengals avoided an 0-3 hole with Joe Burrow able to play in the team's win over the Los Angeles Rams in a Super Bowl 56 rematch.

The Eagles joined the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers as the league's lone 3-0 teams. The Carolina Panthers, Chicago Bears, Denver Broncos and Minnesota Vikings will enter Week 4 winless.

Bengals-Rams highlights

Joe Burrow shook off a lingering calf injury to help the Bengals get their first win of the season.

Eagles-Buccaneers highlights

The defending NFC champion Eagles, who won their first eight games a year ago, are off to a 3-0 start in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1992-93.

Bengals hold on for season's first win

Joe Burrow and the Cincinnati Bengals have their first win of the season.

The Bengals defeated the Los Angeles Rams, 19-16, to win Monday night.

Cincinnati was led by a superb effort by its defense. The Bengals sacked Matthew Stafford six times, linebacker Logan Wilson intercepted the quarterback twice, they forced the Rams to go 1-for-4 in the red zone and 1-for-11 on third downs.

“When you have a defense like that, it makes your job as a quarterback easy,” Burrow told the ESPN broadcast after the game.

Burrow was hampered by his highly publicized calf injury, but got through the contest. The quarterback was 26-of-49 passing for 259 yards and had one interception. Cincinnati’s offense got a major spark from wide receiver Ja'Marr Chase who produced a game-high 12 catches for 141 yards.

Rams defensive tackle Aaron Donald had seven tackles, one sack, two tackles for loss and two QB hits in the loss. — Tyler Dragon

Bengals recover onside kick

The Rams were unable to recover the onside kick. Tight end Mitchell Wilcox recovered the football for the Bengals. The Bengals went into victory formation to milk the clock after Wilcox’s recovery. — Tyler Dragon

Bengals 19, Rams 16: Tutu Atwell TD might be too late for LA

The Rams scored a touchdown with 1:03 left in the fourth quarter to set up an onside kick.

Los Angeles put Tutu Atwell in motion and Matthew Stafford found the wide receiver outside for a 1-yard touchdown. The Rams still trail 19-16 after the score.

The game hinges on the onside kick. — Tyler Dragon

Bengals 19, Rams 6: Another three-pointer from Evan McPherson

Evan McPherson is having a busy night.

The Bengals kicker made his fourth field goal on Monday night. McPherson hit a 54-yard field to increase Cincinnati’s lead, 19-9. But most importantly, the field goal made the contest a two-possession game with under eight minutes remaining in the fourth quarter. — Tyler Dragon

Ahkello Witherspoon makes spectacular interception

Rams cornerback Ahkello Witherspoon made a huge play when his team needed it.

Witherspoon made a miraculous interception on the team’s 37-yard line. He was all over Tyler Boyd in coverage and made a diving catch around Boyd as the wideout attempted to catch the football.

The interception was the Rams first takeaway for the season. — Tyler Dragon

Bengals control third quarter

The Bengals outscored the Rams 10-3 in the third quarter to take a 16-9 advantage. Cincinnati gained 124 yards in the third quarter compared to 100 by Los Angeles.

Bengals WR Ja’Marr Chase had five catches for 78 yards and linebacker Logan Wilson had one of his two interceptions in the quarter. — Tyler Dragon

Bengals 16, Rams 9: Evan McPherson kicks another field goal

The Bengals offense got into field goal range after the takeaway by the defense.

Cincinnati went on a six-play, 48-yard drive to get into field goal range. The series was highlighted by a great play design by Zac Taylor and the Bengals offense that led to a 43-yard catch by wideout Ja’Marr Chase.

Bengals kicker Evan McPherson made a 48-yard field goal to push their lead to 16-9. McPherson is three for four on field goal attempts.

The Bengals have scored 10 straight points. — Tyler Dragon

Logan Wilson gets his second pick

Logan Wilson has a nose for the football.

The Bengals linebacker intercepted his second pass of the night when he caught a Matthew Stafford pass that was deflected at the line of scrimmage.

Wilson has three tackles and two interceptions midway through the third quarter. — Tyler Dragon

Bengals 13, Rams 9: Joe Mixon finally finds the end zone

The Bengals scored the first touchdown of the night.

Cincinnati was able to get Ja’Marr Chase, Tee Higgins and Joe Mixon involved on a 10-play, 75-yard touchdown drive. Mixon capped off the series when he took a handoff, found space and scampered for a 14-yard touchdown run. It was the first rushing TD for the Bengals this season.

The 75-yard drive was the Bengals’ longest drive of the night. — Tyler Dragon

Eagles easily dispatch Bucs to go to 3-0

There were nine 2-0 teams entering Week 3, but only three survived the weekend unbeaten. The Eagles joined the Miami Dolphins and San Francisco 49ers as the league's lone 3-0 teams after a convincing 25-11 defeat of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.

The 25-11 final score also represents a Scorigami! (This is the second Scorigami of Week 3; Dolphins 70, Broncos 20 was also a Scorigami.)

D'Andre Swift (16 carries for 130 yards) and A.J. Brown (nine catches for 131 yards) each had big days for the Eagles. Jalen Hurts completed 23 of 37 passes for 277 yards and a nice touchdown toss to Olamide Zaccheaus, but also had two interceptions. As a team, the Eagles had 201 yards rushing.

The Eagles defense dominated the Buccaneers, who entered the game 2-0 after season-opening wins over the Minnesota Vikings and Chicago Bears (each of whom is still winless, though). Baker Mayfield threw his first interception while as a Buccaneers player. Running back Rachaad White was held to just 38 yards on 14 carries. Mike Evans was the Buccaneers' leading receiver, catching five passes for 60 yards. The Eagles outgained the Buccaneers, 472 yards to 174.

While the Eagles take on the NFC East rival Washington Commanders in Week 4, the Buccaneers travel to play the New Orleans Saints. — Jim Reineking

Rams 9, Bengals 6: LA settles for another field goal

The Rams had a promising drive going to open up the second half, but they were unable to reach paydirt.

Los Angeles went 51 yards down the field and into the red zone, but Bengals defensive end Trey Hendrickson sacked Rams QB Matthew Stafford on third down to force a field goal.

The Rams kicker Brett Maher was able to make a 42-yard field goal to give Los Angeles a 9-6 lead.

Maher’s converted three field goals. — Tyler Dragon

Bengals 6, Rams 6: Just field goals so far in Cincy

Neither offense could get going in the first half, but the Bengals did end the second quarter with a 53-yard field goal by kicker Evan McPherson.

The Bengals defense has played well. The Rams are 0-5 on third down and 0-2 in the red zone. Linebacker Logan Wilson intercepted Matthew Stafford in the second quarter.

Bengals QB Joe Burrow hasn’t played well. He’s missed a couple throws and looked limited by his calf injury in the first half. Burrow did perform better as the first half went on.

Burrow is 17 of 31 passing for 141 yards.

The Rams have 141 total yards in the first half. — Tyler Dragon

Eagles 25, Buccaneers 11: Mike Evans finally gets Tampa a touchdown

It had been rough sledding for the Buccaneers offensive against the Eagles for much of Monday night's game, but Tampa Bay finally did manage to reach the end zone with nine minutes left in the game.

It took three tries from the Eagles' 1-yard line, but Baker Mayfield hit receiver Mike Evans for the score. The subsequent two-point conversion attempt also was good as Mayfield and Chris Godwin connected to trim the Eagles' lead. — Jim Reineking

Eagles 25, Buccaneers 3: Philly converts safety into more points

The Eagles capitalized on the safety, and subsequent decent field position, to march 55 yards on 10 plays and put kicker Jake Elliott into position for a 26-yard field goal attempt.

Elliott's third field goal of the game gave the Eagles a 22-point fourth-quarter lead, seemingly putting the game out of reach for a Buccaneers team that has struggled offensively against the defending NFC champions. — Jim Reineking

Bengals pick off Matthew Stafford

The Bengals defense is doing their best to keep the game close.

Linebacker Logan Wilson intercepted a pass thrown by Matthew Stafford at the Rams’ 41-yard line.

Officials had to review Wilson’s interception to make sure he secured the football and the play was upheld.

Unfortunately, the Bengals squandered the good opportunity. The Bengals offense was unable to move the ball and didn’t score points off the turnover. — Tyler Dragon

Eagles 22, Buccaneers 3: Bucs get INT, but then allow safety

Buccaneers defensive back Dee Delaney made a spectacular interception on a long pass attempt, preventing a possible Eagles score on a Jalen Hurts toss to DeVonta Smith.

Only one issue for the Buccaneers: Delaney was ruled out of bounds at the 1-yard line. One play later, Buccaneers running back Rachaad White was tackled in the end zone by Eagles linebacker Nick Morrow for a safety. The play had no chance of escaping safety shame, as the Eagles' defensive line pushed the Bucs' offensive line back, bottling White up.

The Eagles extended their already lengthy lead in the showdown of 2-0 teams. — Jim Reineking

D'Andre Swift hurdles Buccaneers defender

It's been a big weekend for Swifties in the NFL.

D'Andre Swift has more than 100 yards rushing against the Buccaneers. That total includes hurdling over the Buccaneers' Antoine Winfield Jr. on an electric 26-yard gain.

The big play helped set up Jalen Hurts' 1-yard touchdown score that put the Eagles up 20-3. — Jim Reineking

Aaron Donald bursts through to sack Joe Burrow

The Bengals have done a decent job protecting Joe Burrow in the first half but it didn’t work on this play.

Rams star defensive tackle Aaron Donald was able to split a double team and sacked Burrow for an eight-yard loss. The sack put a halt on Cincinnati’s drive.

Donald currently has two tackles and one sack so far tonight. — Tyler Dragon

Eagles 20, Buccaneers 3: Jalen Hurts powers in for TD on fourth down

Philadelphia is pulling ahead in its road game in Tampa.

On the first drive after halftime, Jalen Hurts scored a 1-yard touchdown.

On fourth-and-goal, he lined up under center Jason Kelce, took the snap, ducked his head and powered his way into the end zone. He scored with the help of tight end Dallas Goedert and running back D'Andre Swift pushing him forward.

The Eagles are up 20-3. — Victoria Hernandez

Rams 6, Bengals 3: Rams settle again for field goal

The Rams squandered another red zone opportunity.

Los Angeles had to kick another short field goal when they failed to get in the endzone from third-and-3 from the five-yard line.

Rams wide receiver Tutu Atwell almost caught a pass from Matthew Stafford on third down but it fell incomplete.

Brett Maher made a 23-yard field goal to give the Rams a 6-3 lead.

The Rams are currently 0-2 in the red zone. — Tyler Dragon

Bengals 3, Rams 3: Evan McPherson puts Cincy on the board

It took a quarter, but the Bengals finally got on the scoreboard.

The Bengals had a 12-play, 48-yard drive that ended in a game-tying 49-yard field goal by Evan McPherson.

Cincinnati relied on short passes to get into field goal range. The Bengals have 98 total yards early in the second quarter. — Tyler Dragon

Joe Burrow starts game, but clearly limited

The first quarter ended with the Bengals driving in Rams territory.

Bengals QB Joe Burrow is clearly limited by his calf injury. The Bengals have emphasized short quick passes to protect Burrow from a pass rush.

Burrow was 10 for 13 passing for 70 yards in the first quarter. — Tyler Dragon

Eagles 13, Buccaneers 3: Eagles kick FG before half to extend lead

The Eagles capitalized off Rachaad White’s fumble to further their lead.

Jalen Hurts led the team on a five-play, 16-yard drive. With nine seconds on the clock, Jake Elliott took the field and nailed a 38-yard field goal.

Philadelphia is up 13-3 at the half. — Victoria Hernandez

Eagles, Buccaneers trade turnovers

After taking the field thanks to a Baker Mayfield interception, Jalen Hurts himself was picked late in the second quarter.

He intended to reach D'Andre Swift and threw toward the center of the field, but threw the ball right behind the running back’s post route. Devin White was there to take the pick and run upfield for a 26-yard return.

The Eagles defense answered by taking the ball right back. They sacked Baker Mayfield for a loss of 11 yards and then on the next play, Jalen Carter forced Rachaad White to fumble a short catch. His teammate James Bradberry landed on the ball.

The game had three straight turnovers, including Mayfield’s first interception of the game — and the season. — Victoria Hernandez

Rams 3, Bengals 0: Tutu Atwell run sets up field goal

The Rams took advantage of good field position after the Bengals missed a field goal on their opening drive.

Los Angeles converted a short 30-yard field goal on its first drive.

Wide receiver Tutu Atwell nearly scored on a reverse, but the refs ruled he had stepped out of bounds on the two-yard line. On the very next play, Rams QB Matthew Stafford was sacked by Bengals DT DJ Reader and Los Angeles eventually had to settle for a chip-shot field goal by kicker Brett Maher. — Tyler Dragon

Baker Mayfield throws first INT of season

As the rain started pouring in Tampa Bay, Baker Mayfield threw his first interception of the season.

On second-and-13 from their on 22, the quarterback took the snap from shotgun and then threw downfield intending to reach Chris Godwin.

The receiver had several defenders in front of him. The ball was short and fell into the hands of safety Reed Blankenship, who dove to his left into the turf with the grab.

Blankenship had his first career interception last year as an undrafted rookie when he picked off Aaron Rodgers in a primetime win.

The pick of Mayfield was Tampa Bay’s first turnover of the season. — Victoria Hernandez

Eagles 10, Buccaneers 3: Jalen Hurts finds Olamide Zaccheaus for first TD of game

Jalen Hurts scored the first touchdown of the game against the Buccaneers, finding Olamide Zaccheaus for a 34-yard score.

On third-and-10, the Eagles quarterback took the snap and stutter-stepped in the pocket for a few seconds as he surveyed the field. Linebacker Anthony Nelson broke through the offensive line and closed in on Hurts, but he tossed the ball downfield and threaded it between two defenders to find the fifth-year receiver. Zaccheaus trotted into the end zone for the score.

Zaccheaus had a 24-yard catch on the drive that helped Philadelphia move downfield.

The Eagles are up 10-3 in the second quarter. — Victoria Hernandez

Buccaneers 3, Eagles 3: Tampa Bay settles for field goal after Mike Evans drop

The Bucs put together their best drive thus far in the first half and it ended with three points.

Tampa Bay’s 13-play, 69-yard drive almost ended in a touchdown, but Mike Evans dropped a would-be touchdown pass from Baker Mayfield that was just a little behind the wide receiver.

The Bucs settled for a 33-yard field goal by kicker Chase McLaughlin. — Tyler Dragon

Eagles controlling game through one quarter in Tampa

The Eagles had the football when the first quarter expired.

Philadelphia controlled the first quarter with 113 total yards compared to just 34 by the Bucs. The Eagles had six first downs in the first quarter. — Tyler Dragon

Eagles 3, Buccaneers 0: Britain Covey return sets up field goal

The Eagles got on the scoreboard first Monday night, thanks to a good punt return by Britain Covey.

Covey retrieved a punt and had a 52-yard return to put the Eagles in Bucs territory. The Eagles weren’t able to reach the end zone after starting in Tampa Bay territory but did manage to get three points when kicker Jake Elliott converted a 36-yard field. — Tyler Dragon

Buccaneers vs Eagles predictions

∎ Lorenzo Reyes: Eagles 23, Buccaneers 21

The Bucs are playing with heart and are a nice story. I don’t see them taking down the defending NFC champs, as much as Philly has struggled without Shane Steichen running the offense. I like the under here as well.

∎ Tyler Dragon: Eagles 28, Buccaneers 17

Both the Eagles and Bucs are undefeated. The 2-0 Bucs are a little fools gold, though. Tampa Bay comes back to reality this week with a humbling loss to one of the best teams in the NFL. The Eagles win this one by two scores.

∎ Victoria Hernandez: Eagles 28, Buccaneers 23

Tampa Bay impressed through the first two weeks of the season, but Baker Mayfield is no Jalen Hurts. The Eagles quarterback has had help from running back D’Andre Swift, who torched the Vikings for 175 yards last week, and DeVonta Smith remains reliable.

∎ Jordan Mendoza: Eagles 24, Buccaneers 18

At the end of the day, all that matters is getting the win. The Eagles have gotten the job done in the first two weeks, and its offense will get another test from a strong Tampa Bay defense. While it's not a pretty game, Jalen Hurts is able to find some holes in the Buccaneers defense, while Baker Mayfield comes back down to Earth thanks to a relentless Philadelphia defensive line.

Buccaneers vs. Eagles odds

The Eagles enter Monday as 5.5-point favorites over the Buccaneers, according to BetMGM.

Bengals vs. Rams predictions

∎ Lorenzo Reyes: Bengals 25, Rams 20

Obviously, Joe Burrow’s status will indicate how you should proceed, but Cincinnati will need to wake up offensively at some point. The Rams have been a nice story but they are still inferior to Cincinnati. But that’s only the case if Burrow is healthy enough to go.

∎ Tyler Dragon: Rams 21, Bengals 18

Joe Burrow’s health looms large as the Bengals hope to get out of an early-season hole. The Bengals notoriously start slow with Burrow under center, but life without their standout QB will be very tough. Calf injuries tend to linger for a while.

∎ Victoria Hernandez: Rams 27, Bengals 20

The NFL predicted a much different game when the league selected this matchup for Monday Night Football. It’s going to be far from a rematch of Super Bowl 56. The Bengals have a tough decision to make in whether to play Joe Burrow. Even if the Pro Bowl quarterback does play, he hasn’t been healthy. The player to watch will be Rams rookie receiver Puka Nacua who is breaking records, leads the league in receptions and is second in receiving yards.

∎ Jordan Mendoza: Bengals 24, Rams 23

Both teams have been surprising so far for different reasons, and a Monday night win could certainly turn the page for either Super Bowl 56 team. All eyes will be on whether Joe Burrow suits up, and if he does, Cincinnati will want to turn up the notch for its air attack. The Rams will counter, but the Bengals hold on in a close one for the first win of the season.

Bengals vs. Rams odds

The Bengals enter Monday as 3-point favorites over the Rams, according to BetMGM.

The NFL Week 3 slate, at first glance, appeared to lack some sizzle.

Sunday, though, did offer some compelling revelations and rather unexpected outcomes.

None was more surprising than the Arizona Cardinals hosting the potent Dallas Cowboys and pulling off the upset despite being double-digit underdogs in what could eventually become a culture-setting victory. — Lorenzo Reyes

Seventy-burger? Seriously? You guys know this isn’t the BCS, and no style points are awarded, yeah? (Net points are a low-level tiebreaker, but I digress.) Regardless, what an obviously impressive performance as Miami became the fourth NFL team to reach the 70-point plateau in the Dolphins’ 70-20 dismantling of the Broncos, the most points scored by a team since Washington had 72 in 1966.

UnitedHeath Group (UNH) rallied for a third straight session, while Chevron (CVX) outperformed. West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures were up 1% to around $90.50 a barrel.

Nike (NKE), down 12 out of the past 13 sessions, fell slightly ahead of next week's earnings report. The stock's latest weakness follows a period of 11 straight losses that started Aug. 10.

Top performers like Cintas (CTAS) and Costco (COST) are also on the earnings calendar.

The Dow Jones industrials closed just above the 34,000 level Thursday after two days of volatile price action. Besides the 34,000 level, another support level to watch for the blue-chip index is the 200-day moving average, currently around 33,808. The Dow was up 0.1% at midday.

Outside the Dow Jones

Several Chinese stocks outperformed in the stock market today on a couple of headlines. For starters, a Bloomberg report said that China is considering softening rules that limit foreign ownership in domestic publicly traded firms to spur more investment in China's $9.4 trillion stock market.

Separately, Alibaba (BABA) outperformed early on reports that the company's logistics unit — Cainiao Network Technology — will file for a Hong Kong IPO as early as next week.

Other Chinese stocks with strong early gains in the MarketSmith Growth 250 included Futu Holdings (FUTU), New Oriental Education (EDU), Li Auto (LI) and PDD (PDD).

The Nasdaq composite was up 0.9% approaching the noon hour ET as Magnificent Seven stocks like Meta Platforms (META) (which regained the 300 level), Amazon.com (AMZN) and Nvidia (NVDA) outperformed. Advancing stocks on the Nasdaq had a slight edge over decliners.

The composite could be ready for a major test of the 13,000 level, while NVDA stock continues to hold above the 400 level.

After soaring 13 basis points Thursday to 4.48%, the 10-year Treasury yield dipped 5 basis points to 4.43%.

The S&P 500 added 0.4% and the iShares Russell 2000 ETF (IWM) edged up 0.2%. Winners beat losers on the NYSE by nearly 2 to 1.

Semiconductor-equipment stocks outperformed in the S&P 500, with names like Lam Research (LRCX), KLA (KLAC) and Applied Materials (AMAT) up at least 1.5%.

After several distribution days for the Nasdaq and S&P 500, both indexes have weakened considerably from a technical perspective. Gains in low volume from here would strengthen the bear case. For now, both indexes are under heavy selling pressure and would need to rally quite a bit to break out of their downtrends. The Dow Jones remains also on a downtrend.

Growth Stocks On The Move

Other top gainers in the MarketSmith Growth 250 included Dorian LPG (LPG), which soared 3% and cleared a late-stage cup-with-handle base with a 28.69 entry. The company is a global shipper of liquefied petroleum gas.

After a nice close off lows Thursday, Oceaneering (OII) rallied 3%. It's still in a buy zone from an alternate entry of 23.80.

In the enterprise software group, Nutanix (NTNX) rallied nicely off its 21-day exponential moving average. It's still in a buy zone after gapping up on earnings earlier this month.

In the insurance group, Ryan Specialty Holdings (RYAN) jumped to an all-time high after a couple of tight weekly closes. It broke out of a three-weeks-tight pattern with a 49.77 buy point.

Fellow insurer Travelers (TRV) was flat in the Dow Jones index after a recent rise above its 50-day line. But the stock's 200-day line around 176 is a potential resistance level to watch.

398,2023/09/26,'brooks robinson',https://www.espn.com/mlb/story/_/id/38498947/hall-fame-3b-orioles-legend-brooks-robinson-dies-86,"Open Extended Reactions

BALTIMORE -- Hall of Fame third baseman Brooks Robinson, whose deft glovework and folksy manner made him one of the most beloved and accomplished athletes in Baltimore history, has died. He was 86.

""We are deeply saddened to share the news of the passing of Brooks Robinson,"" his family and the Orioles said in a joint statement. ""An integral part of our Orioles Family since 1955, he will continue to leave a lasting impact on our club, our community, and the sport of baseball.""

The statement did not say how Robinson died.

The Orioles held a moment of silence before their game against the Washington Nationals, and the teams lined up outside their dugouts to pay their respects. Also before the game, fans gathered around the 9-foot bronze statue of Robinson inside Camden Yards.

""I think a lot of guys tonight played with a heavy heart,"" Orioles manager Brandon Hyde said after Baltimore's 1-0 victory. ""He's an icon in this game and an icon in this city. There's not many of those.""

Coming of age before the free agent era, Robinson spent his entire 23-year career with the Orioles. He almost single-handedly helped Baltimore defeat Cincinnati in the 1970 World Series and homered in Game 1 of the Orioles' 1966 sweep of the Los Angeles Dodgers for their first crown.

""Great player, great guy on the field, great guy off,"" said fellow Orioles Hall of Famer Jim Palmer, who was overcome with emotion. ""Respectful, kind. And you don't meet too many guys like that. Brooks was a genuine person. There was no acting. Brooks was just a genuine person.""

Robinson participated in 18 All-Star Games and earned the 1964 AL Most Valuable Player award after batting .318 with 28 home runs and a league-leading 118 RBIs. He finished his career with 268 homers, 1,357 RBIs and a respectable .267 batting average in 2,896 career games.

But he will be forever remembered for his work ethic and the skill he displayed at the hot corner, where he established himself as one of the finest fielding third baseman in baseball history, whether charging slow rollers or snaring liners down the third-base line.

Known as the ""Human Vacuum Cleaner,"" Robinson won 16 consecutive Gold Gloves -- second only to pitcher Greg Maddux's (18) for most by a player at one position. Robinson also places third in career defensive WAR at 39.1 behind shortstops Ozzie Smith (44.2) and Mark Belanger (39.5), who was Robinson's teammate for 13 years with the Orioles.

""Brooks was maybe the last guy to get into the clubhouse the day of the game, but he would be the first guy on the field,"" former Orioles manager Earl Weaver said. ""He'd be taking his groundballs, and we'd all go, 'Why does Brooks have to take any groundballs?'

""I wouldn't expect anything else from Brooks. Seeing him work like that meant a lot of any young person coming up. He was so steady, and he steadied everybody else.""

Houston Astros manager Dusty Baker recalled Robinson's friendship during the early years of his career, when he broke in with Atlanta in the late 1960s.

""I'm just sad. Another great one is called to heaven,"" Baker said. ""They got some all-stars up there.

""He was really nice to me when I was a rookie with the Braves. We used to barnstorm with him all the time and he was a real gentleman. ... I never heard anything negative about him, ever. And he was on a team that with the Orioles had a number of African-American players. I think they had 10 or 12. They all loved him. That's saying a lot. Especially back in that day.""

Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1937, Robinson eventually made Baltimore his home but never really lost his southern twang, which was just fine with fans in blue-collar Baltimore, who appreciated his homespun charm and unassuming demeanor.

Dubbed ""Mr. Oriole,"" he was a sports hero in Charm City, in the pantheon with former Colts quarterback Johnny Unitas and Orioles infielder Cal Ripken, who performed for a different generation.

Ripken was known as The Iron Man because he played in 2,632 consecutive games, but Robinson wasn't fond of sitting on the bench, either. From 1960-1975, he played in at least 152 games in 14 seasons and in 144 games the other two years.

""I'm a guy who just wanted to see his name in the lineup everyday,"" he said. ""To me, baseball was a passion to the point of obsession.""

Robinson retired in 1977 after batting only .149 in 24 games. His jersey was retired that year.

""I will always remember Brooks as a true gentleman who represented our game extraordinarily well on and off the field all his life,"" MLB commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement. ""On behalf of Major League Baseball, I send my deepest condolences to Brooks' family, his many friends across our game, and Orioles fans everywhere.""

Robinson's most memorable performance came as MVP of the 1970 World Series, when the Orioles bounced back from their stunning defeat to the New York Mets the year before and Robinson redeemed himself after batting just 1 for 19 in that series. Because he was so sensational in the field during Baltimore's five-game triumph over the Reds, few remember he hit .429 and homered twice and drove in six runs -- or that he made an error on his first play in the field.

In Game 1, Robinson delivered the tiebreaking home run in the seventh inning. One inning earlier, he made a sensational backhanded grab of a hard grounder hit down the line by Lee May, spun around in foul territory and somehow threw out the runner.

Robinson contributed an RBI single in the second game and became forever a part of World Series lore with his standout performance in Game 3. He made a tremendous, leaping grab of a grounder by Tony Perez to start a first-inning double play; charged a slow roller in the second inning and threw out Tommy Helms; then capped his memorable afternoon with a diving catch of a liner by Johnny Bench. The Series ended, fittingly, with a ground out to Robinson in Game 5, a 9-3 Orioles win.

""I'm beginning to see Brooks in my sleep,"" Reds manager Sparky Anderson said during the Series. ""If I dropped this paper plate, he'd pick it up on one hop and throw me out at first.""

Robinson was elected into the Hall of Fame on the first ballot in 1983. In 1999, he was named to baseball's All-Century team, which honored the best 25 players of the 20th century. His No. 5 is one of just six jerseys retired by the Orioles franchise.

Starting in 2009, Robinson was beset by a string of health scares. He was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2009, had abdominal surgery in 2010, developed an infection while recovering from the abdominal surgery in 2011 and in 2012 his chair fell off a platform at a banquet, forcing him to spend a month in the hospital.

In his later years, Robinson auctioned off nearly all of his vast memorabilia.

""My children, they have everything they ever wanted from my collection,"" Robinson said in 2015. ""We've been very blessed, my whole family, all the years we've been in Baltimore. So it's time to give back.""

Robinson said ""every cent"" of the proceeds was to go to the Constance and Brooks Robinson Foundation for distribution to worthy causes.

In July 2018, Robinson was announced as the Orioles' special adviser, with Robinson saying he'll be more focused on community events.

""I talked to [chair and managing partner] John Angelos about three weeks ago, and we had lunch,"" Robinson said. ""I told him, 'I'll do anything, but I don't want to have to make any decisions about baseball. That's passed me by, if you want to know the truth.'""

In addition to his role in the Orioles front office, Robinson also served as president of the Major League Baseball Players Alumni Association.

399,2023/09/26, 'alexandra grant',https://people.com/keanu-reeves-girlfriend-alexandra-grant-opens-up-about-their-relationship-7973905,"Alexandra Grant is shedding new light on her relationship with boyfriend Keanu Reeves!

The accomplished visual artist, 50, attended the Los Angeles Beverly Arts Icon Awards on Friday sans Reeves, 59, and when asked if it is harder or easier to tackle red carpets alone, gave a thoughtful answer.

“The good news about falling in love as an adult is that I had built my own career by the time that my relationship had begun,” she tells PEOPLE. “I feel very confident in the relationship on the red carpet. I feel confident on it alone.”

""It's interdependent and independent in the best ways,” she adds.

While Grant, an honoree at the ceremony, hit the red carpet solo at The Four Seasons Hotel in Los Angeles, she has been photographed at several events with Reeves since the pair made their public debut as a couple in 2019.

When asked how she and the John Wick star — who started off as friends and collaborators — interact with each other’s professional environments, Grant began her response by recalling a moment she felt stuck creatively.

“In a moment of frustration in my life, I once said, ‘Sometimes I feel like a Maserati stuck in traffic,' that I have this big engine, but, for a variety of reasons, that I couldn't ever go,” she tells PEOPLE. “And I know a lot of people feel frustrated in their lives, that they're not able to run their engine.”

She adds: “I think every creative person feels that way.”

“What I love about Keanu and our exchange is that we're pushing each other to build new roads,” she says. “Seeing the other person's problem-solving is inspiring, like, ‘Oh, well, okay, this one, that's a cul-de-sac. How do I try this other thing?’ ”

“He's such an inspiration to me,” she continues. “He's so creative, he's so kind. He works so hard.”

Grant also shares that “storytelling is at the heart” of what both she and her actor boyfriend do.

“My work is much more of a private performance, but I have a text that I interpret in the studio into a painting, into an object,” she says. “He takes the text in private and then turns it into a performance in public. There's a relationship. We're both at the heart readers and researchers. We both care about people and we care about characters.”

Grant went on to compare her and Reeves’ creative worlds using a metaphor.

“I think there's a lot of similarities,” she began. “Sometimes I feel like, to make a film, as we're seeing now in the strike, that it's a cruise ship. Everyone is dependent on everyone else. You can't go off and— being an artist, maybe at the beginning of my career, I was in a kayak on the sea of creativity. Now maybe it's a small speedboat, but it's still a lot more nimble.”

“I think that is very inspiring for him,” she said of Reeves and the “cruise ship”-like nature of making a movie.

She continues, “To make a film, you require hundreds of people. To be an artist, you don't. You require one. You require a community to get the work into the world, but not to actually make it. I think part of the inspiration is the differences of scale.”

According to Grant, her art has “absolutely” changed since she began dating Reeves.

“I had a studio visit a few years ago, and this very kind, very high-level person said, 'I can see that your work has gotten happier,’ ” she remembers. “That's real. We're all human beings. We're animals. We're expressing from where we are and certainly feeling happier. I think the work is happier.”

Both Grant and Reeves dedicated their Friday nights to art. The Matrix star had to miss the ceremony to perform with his band Dogstar, according to Grant.

“I'm really proud,” she says. “I am a huge Dogstar fan. I had the great pleasure of going to their first public show and because I've been listening to the latest album for quite some time, I was one of the only people in the audience who knew all the lyrics. That was really cool. It's fun. It's beyond fun.”

She continues, “I was dancing to all the lyrics and then I looked around and I was like, ‘Nobody has heard the album except for me and a few people.’ It's been a real pleasure to see the guys come back together, to be so creative and supportive of one another.”

Grant says she is “so proud” and “happy” for Reeves’ alternative rock band, which reunited this year for the first time in 20 years.

“I'm glad they're able to do it,” she says, adding that she thinks it’s “really great that Keanu has the ability to pivot to being a musician” amid the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and SAG-AFTRA strikes.

“They had been playing music and rehearsing and they had already recorded most of the album before the strike,” she adds. “What it opened up was more time to go on the road.”

Benberry, who met Kelce in 2016 on his E! dating series, “Catching Kelce,” described Swift’s fanbase, known as Swifties, as “aggressive” and “very hypocritical,” in a Thursday interview with “Inside Edition.” The reality TV personality said she’s faced backlash after implying that Kelce may cheat on Swift.

Benberry told the Daily Mail earlier this week that she wished Swift “the best of luck” in their romance, but also warned, “I wouldn’t be a girls’ girl if I didn’t advise her to be smart.”

“I’m sure by now she has mastered the ability to see who is really there for her — and who is just using her,” she said.

She went on to repeat allegations that Kelce cheated on her when they dated in 2016.

“Only time will tell, but like the saying always goes, once a cheater, always a cheater,” she continued.

During an interview with “Inside Edition” on Thursday, Benberry doubled down on her cheating allegations and said she received death threats from Swift’s fanbase.

“Swifties are aggressive, very negative, very hypocritical,” Benberry said. “It’s really crazy to me that someone I think is positive and really nice would have such a negative and angry fan base.”

After outlasting 49 other contestants on Kelce’s dating show, Benberry and the now-two-time Super Bowl champ dated for eight months, she said, adding that they loved each other and were thinking about marriage. However, the pair broke up the following year. In May 2017, Benberry alleged in since-deleted tweets that Kelce had cheated on her with sports broadcaster and model Kayla Nicole.

Though Kelce has yet to address the allegations, a source close to him told TMZ that Kelce never cheated on Benberry and called the statements, “A poor excuse of someone trying to get her 15 min of fame.” A representative for Kelce did not immediately respond to The Times’ request for comment.

Benberry said in the “Inside Edition” interview that she was offended by the statement given to TMZ and said she felt Kelce and his camp were “laughing” and “mocking” her.

“I’m not jealous or bitter about Taylor — she’s beautiful, she’s successful, we’re in two different lanes — my issue is more with Travis, in the sense of now you’re trying to turn me into a bitter person, or a liar, like I’m delusional, and I’m the furthest thing from that,” she said.

Benberry also shared on X, formerly known as Twitter, a screenshot of a text message to someone she said worked at “Inside Edition,” in which she wrote that the TV segment portrayed her as “some bitter Black woman that is attacking a guy because he’s dating Taylor Swift.” She said her initial goal for the sit-down was to shed light on the way her relationship with Kelce was edited and manipulated in the 2016 reality TV show.

“I learned a lot of lessons these past few days but I don’t regret at all on speaking my truth,” Benberry said in another tweet.

Interest in Kelce and Swift’s rumored romance exploded last weekend when the “Lover” singer attended the Kansas City Chiefs-Chicago Bears game at Arrowhead Stadium, cheering on Kelce alongside his mother and friends. The pair were seen leaving the game together.

Kelce recently talked about the Grammy winner in the latest episode of his podcast, “New Heights,” calling Swift going to the game “pretty ballsy.”

“I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her, the friends and family,” he told his brother, fellow NFL star and podcast co-host Jason Kelce. “She looked amazing. Everybody was talking about her in a great light and on top of that, the day went perfect for Chiefs fans, of course.”"

402,2023/09/26, 'cassidy hutchinson',https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/26/politics/cassidy-hutchinson-book-trump-white-house-chaos/index.html,"Washington CNN —

In her new book “Enough,” former White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson paints the closing days of the Trump White House as even more chaotic and lawless than she previously disclosed in her shocking televised testimony last summer. President Donald Trump lashes out unpredictably and makes wild demands. Chief of staff Mark Meadows leaks classified documents to friendly right-wing media figures and burns documents. Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani gropes Hutchinson inappropriately the day of the Capitol insurrection.

She also depicts major Republican figures, including Speaker Kevin McCarthy, stating clearly behind the scenes what they refrained from telling the American people: that Joe Biden won the presidential election and Trump lost.

Hints that integrity wasn’t exactly the word of the day were there from the beginning, of course. “Cass, if I can get through this job and manage to keep (Trump) out of jail, I’ll have done a good job,” Meadows told Hutchinson in June 2020.

Hutchinson’s book describes her meteoric rise from idealistic Capitol Hill intern at the beginning of the Trump administration to the indispensable aide to the White House chief of staff in the president’s final year. Hutchinson, whose testimony before the January 6 committee provided the most damning inside account of Trump’s actions – and lack of action – on January 6, describes her internal struggle about what transpired at the end of the Trump administration and how she ultimately chose to come forward and testify fully about what she saw in the West Wing.

“I think that Donald Trump is the most grave threat we will face to our democracy in our lifetime, and potentially in American history,” Hutchinson told CNN’s Jake Tapper in an interview Tuesday.

To hear Hutchinson tell it, the Trump world felt almost like a criminal organization where loyalty was prized above everything. After one 2020 campaign rally, Meadows asked her, “Would you take a bullet for him?” – meaning Trump.

“Could it be to the leg?” Hutchinson tried to joke back.

Meadows responded that he would “do anything” to get Trump reelected.

After Trump’s indoor, mask-free rally in Tulsa, Oklahoma, at the height of the Covid pandemic, attendee and former GOP presidential candidate Herman Cain contracted the virus and died.

“We killed Herman Cain,” Meadows told Hutchinson and asked for his wife’s phone number.

A spokesman for Meadows disputed Hutchinson’s account in a statement to CNN. The spokesperson said it was offensive to suggest this was Meadows’ initial reaction to Cain’s death. “In the days after he was expressing exasperation that the media would blame the President for Mr. Cain’s death. Very different,” the spokesperson said.

That did little to change the White House’s attitude about masking. In fact, at one visit to an N-95 plant, Hutchinson advised Trump to remove his mask before facing the cameras because his bronzer is smearing on its elastic straps. In another instance in the frenzy after the election, visitors to the White House who tested positive for Covid were admitted regardless because Trump insisted on meeting with them.

These ethical mores or – or the lack thereof – were taken to the campaign trail where, Hutchinson writes, Meadows met furtively with former Hunter Biden business associate Tony Bobulinski while being shielded from public view by Secret Service agents.

Hutchinson didn’t start truly questioning the men she worked alongside until after the election, but even then, it was late coming. As Trump watched Giuliani’s notorious hair-dye-leaking press conference at the Republican National Committee headquarters, he shouted, according to Hutchinson, “Somebody make this stop! Get him off! Make him stop!”

But even then, she says, she “didn’t blame the president for any of it yet. I didn’t want to blame him. I felt strongly that he should concede the election, and I worried that we were surrounding him with people who fueled his most impulsive behaviors. I knew things could get out of hand, and fast.”

‘I don’t want people to know we lost, Mark’

Meadows emerges in the book as not only duplicitous but as a fall guy for folks who don’t want to admit that Trump had lost grip with reality. Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe expressed concern about the president’s unpredictability, noting that one minute “he acknowledges he lost… Then he’ll immediately backpedal.”

McCarthy told Hutchinson the same thing. They both blamed Meadows. After the US Supreme Court declined to hear the bizarre lawsuit filed by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, full of lies and false claims about the election, Trump pushed Meadows, “Why didn’t we make more calls? We needed to do more. … We can’t let this stand.”

Trump continued, “I don’t want people to know we lost, Mark. This is embarrassing. Figure it out.” Even then, when Meadows assured Trump he would work on it, Hutchinson’s irritation is with Meadows for giving Trump false hope, not with Trump for demanding that his delusions become reality.

Hutchinson’s claim that Trump admitted to Meadows that he lost is the latest in a series of eye-witness accounts of Trump periodically admitting in private to having lost the election. Hutchinson testified to both federal investigators and the Fulton County grand jury, she writes, though she was not referenced in any of the indictments of Trump.

Hutchinson describes a White House that in its final weeks had turned to utter lawlessness, with Meadows regularly burning documents in the fireplace of the chief of staff’s office. After Meadows’ office became smoky before a meeting, former GOP Rep. Devin Nunes asked Hutchinson, “How often is he burning papers?” When Meadows’ wife came to help pack his office in January 2021, she pleaded to Hutchinson, “Mark doesn’t need to burn anything else. All of his suits smell like a bonfire.”

The Meadows spokesperson said that Hutchinson’s telling was an “absurd mischaracterization.”

“Mrs. Meadows was referencing how the wood fireplace made the office smell smoky — and we often started it using old newspaper. It had nothing to do with documents,” the spokesperson said.

On that wild day of December 18, 2020, when Trump considered proposals in the Oval Office to seize voting machines, White House deputy chief of staff Tony Ornato told Hutchinson he “heard the president talk about the Insurrection Act or martial law,” she writes.

Hutchinson writes that at one point during the Oval Office meeting, she heard Trump screaming, “I don’t care how you do it just get it fucking done!” It’s unclear what the ‘it’ referred to however.



As senior staffers tried to get Meadows to return to the White House to get the likes of his onetime national security adviser Mike Flynn, former Trump attorney Sidney Powell, and former Overstock CEO Patrick Byrne to leave the Oval Office, White House staff secretary Derek Lyons asked, “Does the chief really need more of a reason to come back? Here it is. Martial law.”

Those plans, of course, did not come to fruition, and Trump looked for other avenues to overturn his election loss, pressuring Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to “find” 11,780 votes to flip the Peach State from Biden to Trump.

“That call was not good,” White House counsel Pat Cipollone told Meadows, according to Hutchinson, who writes that Cipollone was listening in on the call. Testifying under oath to the January 6 committee last year, Cipollone said he had no memory of knowing about the call until he read about it in the press.

In a statement to CNN, a spokesman for Cipollone denied he was on the Georgia call, noting that Cipollone was not among those Meadows introduced at the start of the call.

‘I think It’s going to go well’

In the weeks after the election, January 6 remained the fail-safe, and Hutchinson writes that Trump visiting Capitol Hill was part of the plan until the very end. “On New Year’s Eve, (Meadows) asked me to talk to Tony (Ornato) about a potential motorcade movement to Capitol Hill following the president’s rally.”

“I think the Sixth is going to go well,” Trump said. “Do you think it’s going to go well, Chief?”

“Yes, sir,” Meadows replied. “I think it’s going to go well.”

Many of the stories Hutchinson tells about that day were parts of her testimony. Trump knew about the weapons his supporters were carrying – “Big guy knows,” Ornato said, and at this point in the narrative, Hutchinson still found that news reassuring, as if it meant Trump would do something to stop it. She recounts the tell-tale moment at the Ellipse when she heard the president roaring: “Take the fucking mags (metal detectors) down … Look at all those people in the trees. They want to come in. Let them. Let my people in. Take the fucking mags away. They’re not here to hurt me.”

Soon after, backstage at the rally, Giuliani slipped his hand up Hutchinson’s skirt and up her thigh, Hutchinson alleges in the book. (Giuliani denied her allegation to Newsmax, calling it “absurd.”) She stormed away, filled with rage. But it was nothing compared with the rage she later felt after the Capitol was attacked and people died, Hutchinson writes.

As the attack on the Capitol unfolded, Hutchinson said thoughts raced through her mind about what she needed to do – and she worried it could be the beginning of a coup.

“We have to have a plan in place in case the worst happens. In case this is the beginning of a coup,” she writes.

Even this was not enough yet. Hutchinson remained part of Team Trump. Unlike White House communications director Alyssa Farah, who resigned on December 3, 2020, or deputy White House press secretary Sarah Matthews, who left on January 6, 2021, Hutchinson remained.

Part of Hutchinson’s rationale was that she saw herself as someone who could help maintain protocols during the final days of the Trump presidency, particularly as Meadows scrambled to get hold of a binder containing highly classified documents related to the FBI’s Crossfire Hurricane investigation into Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia during the 2016 election.

She was shocked when Meadows gave the classified documents to two right-wing media personalities who regularly toe the MAGA line.

The Meadows spokesman said that Hutchinson’s account was false, and that the documents had already been declassified by Trump. The White House counsel’s office asked for the documents back, the spokesperson said, because they contained elements of personal information that needed to be redacted.

“It was not an issue of classification – it was about procedural redactions,” the spokesperson said.

Hutchinson, however, writes that Cipollone told her the documents were still full of classified information, and he demanded their return. Before she could leave to call Meadows, Cipollone added: “Hey Cass, while you’re on the phone with him, can you tell him we cannot pardon Kimberly Guilfoyle’s gynecologist?”

“My jaw was hanging as I turned around to look at Pat. I knew by the look on his face that he was dead serious,” she writes.

According to Guilfoyle’s testimony to the January 6 committee, she was seeking to help the son of her former gynecologist, a well-respected California doctor.

‘We just want to protect the president’

The book is a journey, with Hutchinson judging herself to have been “complicit” in the decisions that led to January 6. After telling the story of her troubled upbringing – with a largely absent and ultimately abusive father – Hutchinson’s story is mostly about her time working for a president she once “adored.”

Initially, Hutchinson says, she was “transfixed” by Trump and how he electrified the crowds at his rallies. Working in the White House, first in the Office of Legislative Affairs and then under Meadows, she focused on her mission of helping the president and being a “loyal foot soldier,” she writes.

Numerous examples of Trump’s questionable behavior are glossed over as Hutchinson, ever the loyal aide, saw them as normal at the time. That includes Trump’s 2019 phone call with Zelensky that ultimately led to his first impeachment and the 2020 Atlantic story about Trump referring to American soldiers killed during World War I as “losers” and “suckers” – which a former senior administration official with firsthand knowledge confirmed to CNN.

In the summer of 2017, Trump’s first year in office, Hutchinson was an intern in Sen. Ted Cruz’s office. By 2020, she was dressing down the Texas Republican senator for showing up uninvited to Trump’s arrival on a Texas tarmac, warning him that if he didn’t leave it would be the “last presidential event you ever receive an invitation to.”

Trump loyalists attack Hutchinson to this day as having tried to work for the 45th president in Florida well past January 6, 2021, and Hutchinson fully owns up to that, making clear that her break with the president and his team didn’t come until Meadows fully made clear she wouldn’t be part of the post-presidency – a move that didn’t happen until her final three days in the White House.

Much of what Trump loyalists throw at her to discredit her – for instance, her pleading for help in getting a lawyer – she admits in “Enough.”

The House January 6 committee made much of Hutchinson changing lawyers because of suggestions that her first, Stefan Passantino, was encouraging her to be less than truthful under oath. Hutchinson writes that Passantino discouraged her from fully cooperating. “No, no, no. We want to get you in and get you out,” he told her.

“We were to downplay my role, he explained, as strictly administrative. I was an assistant, nothing more,” she writes. “Stefan never told me to lie to the committee. ‘I don’t want you to perjure yourself,’ he insisted. ‘But “I don’t recall” isn’t perjury.’” At another time he told her, “We just want to protect the president,” she writes.

The book also explains one of the mysteries of the January 6 inquiry: With so many uncooperative witnesses, how did the committee know what to ask Hutchinson to get her to disclose her damning testimony while she was still represented by the attorney paid for by Trump world? It turns out, Hutchinson writes, that she coordinated with Farah, who is now a CNN political commentator, telling her everything she knew. Farah spoke with committee vice chair Liz Cheney, who then knew what to ask Hutchinson during the committee’s third closed-door deposition with her.

Jobs are dangled and then withdrawn from Hutchinson as she begins to cooperate with the committee. Soon, she is shut out and then demonized by Trump world. She leaves open the question as to what might have happened historically if Trump and Meadows had trusted her and invited her to Mar-a-Lago.

But Hutchinson’s courageous testimony did occur, so perhaps more important to the republic today is the question of how many more witnesses with Trump-world-funded attorneys involved in current prosecutions and investigations are experiencing the same situation.

How to Watch Watch The Voice Mondays and Tuesdays at 8/7c on NBC and next day on Peacock.

We'll let Horan explain! The Voice Season 24 Coach revealed this fun tidbit after Olivia Minogue's Blind Audition during the premiere episode.

""The first time I ever met Kim Kardashian, I was backstage at an Ariana Grande concert,"" Horan revealed. ""And she brought North, her daughter, and this is how Kim introduced North to me: 'North, this is the guy that sings from your toothbrush.'"" Naturally, Horan's fellow Coaches and the audience thought this anecdote was just delightful. After all, who doesn't want a singing One Direction toothbrush?

Niall Horan on Seasons 23 and 24 of The Voice

Horan first appeared as a Coach on The Voice in Season 23. Not only did Horan win his very first rodeo with Artist Gina Miles, it also marked Blake Shelton's last run on the show.

In a March interview with NBC Insider, Horan opened up about his connection with Shelton. “Blake, he’s like a dad to me,"" Horan said. ""Y’know, he’s really helped me during the show. I’ve really enjoyed his company, and watching him has been a real honor...It's been amazing to work with him and Kelly Clarkson. Meeting them for the first time, the bond that I’ve grown with them has been amazing. It's been so funny to dive into that Southern sense of humor with them and see the stuff that goes on behind-the-scenes. It's been hilarious.""

Fast-forward to Season 24, and Horan's fondness for Shelton hasn't changed.

""I learned a lot from Blake last year sitting next to him,"" Horan told NBC Insider in a September interview. ""That's what they tend to do: stick everyone down beside Blake if you're new. I learned a lot from even just watching him. Nothing that he said. Just watching how he does it. I think that made a lot of difference to how I've been in the show this year.""

For live updates on the latest news on the odds of a government shutdown, read our live updates for Thursday, Sept. 28.

This story has been corrected to clarify the U.S. Postal Service is not affected by a possible government shutdown and workers would be paid normally during a government shutdown.

WASHINGTON−Congress has three days to cut a deal and prevent a government shutdown that would impact millions of Americans.

As of Wednesday morning, lawmakers have made little progress towards averting a crisis that would hit homes across the country Oct. 1.

While it wouldn't be as far reaching as the debt ceiling threat in late May, a shutdown would deeply impact Americans who need the most help: newborns who rely on WIC for infant formula, children who need nutrition assistance, low-income families who rely on Head Start programs for preschool, college students who receive federal grants to pay for their education, people who receive food stamps and more.

As lawmakers continue to fight on Capitol Hill, the country they serve is bracing for a government shutdown that would delay and disrupt American life.

Here’s the latest on the government shutdown fight, where lawmakers are and how it affects you.

How does the government shutdown affect me?

Millions of Americans would be impacted by a government shutdown.

Federal workers would be furloughed without pay. ""Essential"" federal workers, such as those who work for the Federal Aviation Administration, would work without pay − but would receive backpay once a shutdown ends. Numerous subcontractors would be out of work and would not receive backpay.

The impact would stretch far beyond federal workers though. It would also be felt in millions of homes across America.

Here are some ways a government shutdown would impact your family:

Funding for WIC − the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − would stop immediately

Food stamp benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program would remain intact in October but could be impacted after that

Children from low-income families would lose access to Head Start preschool programs

College students could see delays in their student loans

The Food and Drug Administration would delay nonessential food safety inspections

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration would limit its work

Travelers could see delays with receiving passports

National parks could close

The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) would have no money for disaster relief

U.S. Postal Service not affected by a possible government shutdown

The Postal Service is an independent entity generally funded by the sale of its products and services − not tax dollars − and it will not be impacted by a government shutdown, USPS said in a statement. Because it's not impacted, employees will be paid normally.

""Postal Service operations will not be interrupted in the event of a government shutdown, and all Post Offices will remain open for business as usual,"" the statement said.

Biden says government shutdown not ‘inevitable,’ urges House Republicans ‘do their job’

President Joe Biden said Americans need House Republicans to “do their job” as he held out hope Wednesday that a government shutdown can be avoided before the end-of-week deadline for congressional action.

“I don’t think anything is inevitable in politics,” Biden said, speaking in San Francisco at the president’s Council of Advisors on Science and Technology, which recommends federal policy on science and technology.

Biden said a government shutdown would impact “vital work in science and health” including cancer research and food-safety policies.

“The American people need our Republican friends in the House of Representatives to do their job: Fund the government,” Biden said.

Will military get paid in October?

Military pay for millions of active-duty service members and reservists could dry up with a government shutdown – a major difference between the current threatened shutdown and previous recent suspensions of non-essential spending.

“Military personnel will not be paid until such time as Congress appropriates funds available to compensate them for this period of service,” the Defense Department said in a September memo to Pentagon leaders preparing for a potential lapse in spending.

But the department said personnel would continue working regardless. Federal workers are traditionally reimbursed for lapses in funding once Congress agrees to resume spending, but the lapse in paychecks can be difficult for staffers without savings.

“Military personnel on active duty, including reserve component personnel on Federal active duty, will continue to report for duty and carry out assigned duties,” the department said in a Sept. 12 announcement in preparation for a shutdown.

The government has about 1.3 million active-duty service members and 800,000 reservists.

−Bart Jansen

Will a government shutdown affect flights?

The deepest impact would not be on your flight or cruise.

Funding to agencies like the Federal Aviation Administration, Transportation Security Administration and Customs and Border Protection would be on hold. However, the agents who you typically interact with at airports and seaports, and the controllers who oversee your flights are considered essential and will be working without pay during the shutdown.

Impacts on those agencies have more to do with things like hiring and training. All the crucial safety functions like inspections and air traffic control continue.

Consular operations in the U.S. and internationally will also continue normally “as long as there are sufficient fees” collected to support them, according to the most recent guidance from the State Department. “This includes passports, visas, and assisting U.S. citizens abroad.”

There could be economic repercussions, though. A government shutdown is estimated to cost the country's travel economy as much as $140 million per day, according to an analysis for the U.S. Travel Association.

− Zach Wichter and Nathan Diller

Would a government shutdown affect Social Security?

Social Security recipients will continue to receive checks in the event of a government shutdown and Medicare benefits will not be interrupted.

However, employees in the Social Security Administration are likely to be furloughed and government food assistance benefits could see delay.

A few services that are not directly related to Social Security payment benefits and direct-service operations would be temporarily suspended.

Will a government shutdown affect food stamps and WIC?

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, commonly known as SNAP, will continue for at least the month of October, Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack said in a press briefing Monday. But he warned that “if the shutdown were to extend longer than that, there would be some serious consequences to SNAP.”

Funding for the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children − better known as WIC − will stop “immediately when the shutdown occurs,” he said.

The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a contingency fund that may extend the program for a day or two, and some states may have leftover WIC benefits not spent that could extend the program for a week or so in that state.

“But the vast majority of WIC participants would see an immediate reduction and elimination of those benefits, which means the nutrition assistance that’s provided would not be available,” Vilsack said.

What happens to the IRS in a shutdown?

The IRS may have to partially close starting this weekend if there is a government shutdown.

While the agency initially said it would be able to continue operations and pay employees through a shutdown, the IRS reversed course last week, telling the National Treasury Employees their new contingency plan would include some furloughs.

Millions of Americans are still waiting for their tax refunds from the last filing season, and there is concern a shutdown and IRS closure would escalate this backlog.

− Savannah Kuchar

What is the deadline for the government shutdown?

The U.S. government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Sunday, Oct. 1 if lawmakers don't pass a continuing resolution or a federal budget by Sept. 30.

The continuing resolution, a stopgap measure that would temporarily fund the government while lawmakers work to pass a comprehensive budget, would prevent a shutdown from occurring on Oct. 1.

Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said the House will vote Friday on a continuing resolution, but it's unclear if it has enough votes to pass.

−Sudiksha Kochi

Does a government shutdown affect state employees?

A shutdown could impact state employees whose employers depend on federal funds to operate and must shut down certain activities that the government has deemed non-necessary.

In this case, certain state employees could be furloughed until a shutdown passes.

But state employees who receive salaries from private employers who do not rely on federal funds wouldn’t necessarily be impacted.

How does a government shutdown affect the stock market?

While a potential shutdown isn’t expected to have much of an impact on the stock market, experts say it has contributed to the S&P 500's more than 5% dip so far this month, to 4,275.

It's “one of the reasons why you've seen the market weaken,” according to Marc Zabicki, chief investment officer of LPL Financial. But after the potential shutdown begins, “I don't know that you're going to get any stark reaction from asset markets come Oct. 2 next week. I think it's already largely been built into prices.”

While the looming shutdown is contributing to the recent market dip, it’s not the only driver.

September is also a historically weak month for stocks, according to Jeffrey A. Hirsch, CEO of Hirsch Holdings and editor-in-chief of the Stock Trader's Almanac.

Meanwhile, there are a ""lot of other items going on"" that are affecting the market, including higher interest rates, looming student loan payments, the United Auto Workers strike, rising oil prices and more, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices

“We're in a very volatile time now,"" Silverblatt said.

There have been six partial or full government shutdowns since 1990. While some were resolved in less than a week, the most recent in late 2018 and early 2019 lasted over one month.

When looking at the S&P 500’s median performance one month after the shutdown compared with one month prior, the benchmark gained a median of 5.5% with positive returns five out of six times, according to a Wednesday note from Bespoke Investment Group co-founder Paul Hickey.

“Like the people that occupy the chambers of Congress, past shutdowns have been a lot of sound and fury signifying nothing,” the note reads.

In other words, the looming shutdown is ""more of a headline event than a bottom-line event,"" according to Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA Research. Past shutdowns, he said, left ""angered tourists more than disappointed traders.""

A Sept. 13 Wells Fargo report led by global strategist Gery Schollberg and analyst Jennifer Timmerman notes that while the S&P 500 tends to sag before and through the early part of longer shutdowns, “it did not take long for stocks to regain composure after the government reopened in each instance.”

“This time, however, a shutdown risks aggravating other potential body blows to the economy … leaving stocks more exposed to volatility and to extended weakness.”

The report's authors said they believe a shutdown, if it does occur, has the potential to last at least a few weeks because of hardened positions in an increasingly polarized Congress.

""The longer it goes, the more difficult it will become economically and also from an asset market perspective,"" Zabicki of LPL said, adding that Washington's polarization ""increases the risk that something could go wrong.""

However, he said recent history shows that ""these are typically not long-lasting events.”

What is a government shutdown?

A government shutdown means all federal agencies and services officials don’t deem “essential” have to stop their work and close their doors.

Some of those essential services include the U.S. Postal Service delivering mail and people receiving Medicare and Social Security benefits. Those will continue whether or not the government shuts down.

But so-called “non-essential” work can still have significant impacts for federal employees and Americans across the country. Thousands of federal workers would be furloughed, government food assistance benefits could be delayed and some food safety inspections could also be put on pause.

– Marina Pitofsky

What is the meaning of furloughed?

A furlough occurs when an employee is required to take a mandatory and temporary unpaid leave of absence from their work. An employer can furlough employees to cut back costs or manage operations during a potential government shutdown.

A furlough is different from a layoff, which are permanent terminations in which employees can’t return back to work.

-Sudiksha Kochi

When would a government shutdown start?

A government shutdown would start Sunday if lawmakers cannot pass a federal budget or stopgap measure by Sept. 30.

The stopgap, known as a continuing resolution, would prevent an Oct. 1 shutdown by temporarily extending government funding.

−Savannah Kuchar

'Are we going to shut down this weekend? I believe we will'

A government shutdown, some Republicans say, is inevitable at this point given the time crunch Congress is facing and the gridlock between lawmakers.

McCarthy has committed to voting Friday on a stopgap bill to keep the government open, but even if House Republicans pass it along party lines, it’s a non-starter with the Democratic-controlled Senate.

When asked if the two chambers could reconcile their differences ahead of the Sept. 30 funding deadline, Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., a senior appropriator, told reporters, “We all know the answer to that: No, there’s not enough time.”

“Are we going to shut down this weekend? I believe we will and I think conventional wisdom should tell you that,” Womack added. He said he hopes lawmakers could have an “epiphany” and avert a shutdown in the waning days.

Senate blames fractured House GOP caucus for looming government shutdown

Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said on the Senate floor Wednesday morning that McCarthy is aiming for a government shutdown by adhering to ultraconservatives in his party.

He encouraged the House speaker to work in a bipartisan way to pass a stopgap measure in the lower chamber and said the California lawmaker has “twisted himself into pretzels” to “avoid his responsibility of governing.”

“Every bill House Republicans have pushed has been partisan. Every C.R. has been aimed at the hard right and every path they’ve pursued to date will inevitably lead to a shutdown,” Schumer said.

McConnell echoed Schumer’s call for bipartisanship, saying on the Senate floor Wednesday that shutting down the government “isn’t an effective way to make a point."" For Congress to move forward on unresolved funding priorities, they must avert a shutdown, he said.

− Rachel Looker

What's the probability of a government shutdown?

Hold off on placing any bets. If lawmakers in the House and Senate can reach a compromise by Sept. 30 on a dozen bills that would fund the government, a shutdown is off the table. Congress could also pass a temporary measure to keep the government funded, known as a continuing resolution.

But both of those options are unlikely as of Wednesday afternoon. Lawmakers haven’t agreed on all 12 bills they would need to pass, and a group of conservative House Republicans have insisted on hardline spending cuts that have no chance of passing in the Senate, which is currently controlled by Democrats.

Last week, House Democrats and moderate Republicans appeared to start working on a fallback plan, but it’s not clear the rare bipartisan push would receive enough support to dodge a shutdown.

– Marina Pitofsky

What are the 12 appropriation bills?

In order to fund the government, lawmakers must pass 12 appropriations bills – each tailored to a specific government function.

The appropriations bills are handled by their respective subcommittees in both the House and Senate Appropriations Committees. For example, the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense steers the Defense spending bill, which provides funding for the Department of Defense and other related activities.

In previous years, Congress passed an “omnibus” package – a massive bill combining all 12 appropriations bills into one piece of legislation. The change this year is among the concessions House Speaker Kevin McCarthy made to hardline conservatives in his bid for the job in January when he promised to pass all 12 bills separately.

Hard-right lawmakers have argued a vote on each bill would allow for more transparency in the spending process. But with three days left before a government shutdown, it is virtually impossible for Congress to pass all 12 bills in time considering the House has only passed one of the 12 and the Senate hasn't passed any.

The only likely resolution to avert a shutdown is a short-term stopgap measure to keep the government open and buy lawmakers more time to move through the appropriations process.

Latest updates on the government shutdown

GOP lawmakers emerged from a closed-door weekly conference meeting Wednesday, deriding the Senate’s version of a temporary funding bill for its lack of border security provisions. It's the major sticking point for most House Republicans in the government shutdown fight who say any funding measure must include border security language.

“The Senate is going to have to realize that the House is not going to move something that doesn't have border security at its core,” Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., a key negotiator and chair of the centrist Republican Main Street Caucus, told reporters Wednesday morning.

But House GOP requests for an aggressive border security package have almost no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate. That's why Johnson and other Republicans are pinning the blame on Democrats for refusing to cede to their demands even though the House has been consumed by GOP infighting for the past weeks in spending negotiations.

“If they’re not willing to accept that fact, they are standing in the way of us funding this government,” Johnson said.

−Ken Tran

What would happen if the government shuts down?

In a government shutdown, all federal agencies that are not ""essential"" — think U.S. Postal Service, Medicare and Social Security — would stop work.

This means thousands of federal employees would be on furlough and Americans would go without government benefits such as food and housing support.

Air travel will be generally spared: Air traffic controllers and TSA agents will continue working, though without pay. Travelers may also contend with longer wait times and flight delays.

− Savannah Kuchar

How long would the government shutdown last?

Government funding is set to expire on Oct. 1. How long a potential shutdown would last depends on how soon the House and Senate are able to pass a new appropriations plan that President Joe Biden signs.

The length of past government shutdowns have varied, lasting from five days to 21 days.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-FL., said on Fox News’ “Sunday Morning Futures” that if the departments of Labor and Education ""have to shut down for a few days as we get their appropriations in line, that’s certainly not something that is optimal.”

“But I think it’s better than continuing on the current path we are to America’s financial ruin,” Gaetz said.

How long was the last government shutdown?

The last government shutdown lasted from Dec. 22, 2018 to Jan. 25, 2019. Spanning 35 days, it was the longest government shutdown in U.S. history.

It was also the third federal shutdown to occur during the Trump administration; the first lasted three days in January 2018, and the second lasted only a few hours in February 2018.

Why Moody's says a government shutdown could hurt U.S. credit rating

The country’s credit rating could face additional pressure if the government shuts down next week, according to a new report from Moody’s Investors Service.

While a short-lived shutdown would not impact government debt service payments and isn’t expected to disrupt the economy, Moody's said it would “underscore the weakness” of U.S. institutional and governance strength compared to countries with similar credit ratings.

“In particular, it would demonstrate the significant constraints that intensifying political polarization put on fiscal policymaking at a time of declining fiscal strength,” Moody's report reads.

If the potential shutdown does drag on, it would ""likely be disruptive both to the US economy and financial markets,"" although Moody's notes that any government shutdown is more likely to be brief and concentrated in areas with a large government presence, like Washington, D.C.

Does Congress get paid during a shutdown?

Members of Congress will still get paid during a government shutdown. Some lawmakers however, have introduced bills in the past to withhold pay for lawmakers during a shutdown. Rep. Angie Craig, D-Minn., introduced legislation doing just that last Wednesday.

“I’m introducing legislation to block Member pay during a McCarthy shutdown, because it’s ridiculous that we still get paid while folks like TSA workers are asked to work without a paycheck,” Craig said in a statement.

Their staffers however, will not receive pay. Like other federal employees, Congressional staffers and aides considered essential work without pay and receive their paychecks retroactively after the shutdown ends.

The Rams' offense to this point has revolved around the right arm of Matthew Stafford, who has shown no signs of slowing down in his 13th season. Stafford has the second most passing attempts in the NFL (93) and the third most passing yards (641). With a clean pocket and time to throw, the veteran gun slinger can pick apart any defense.

Los Angeles has been efficient in protecting Stafford, limiting Seattle and San Francisco to a combined one sack. For the Bengals to make him uncomfortable and possibly force errant throws, they will need their pass rushers to make an impact.

Namely, Trey Hendrickson can add to his 36.5 sacks since the start of the 2020 season â the fourth most in the league. The Pro Bowler notched one of Cincinnati's three sacks in the season opener at Cleveland, and getting in that column again offers a way to get the Rams' air attack off schedule.

5. Red zone defense

Last week, the Ravens came away with points in each of their four drives that reached the Bengals' 20-yard line, including three that resulted in a touchdown. Cincinnati also had success in the red zone with a pair of TDs and a field goal, but an interception early in the third quarter turned out to be critical in the game's outcome."

Barcelona coach Xavi Hernandez said his side's incredible comeback against Celta Vigo on Saturday was a reflection of the generational change in society.

Robert Lewandowski scored twice in the last 10 minutes before João Cancelo struck in the 89th minute as Barça came from two goals down at the Olympic Stadium to beat Celta 3-2.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)

The late rally meant Barcelona became the first LaLiga team to win in the last 14 seasons when trailing by multiple goals entering the 80th minute, according to ESPN Stats and Information. In that span, teams facing a multi-goal deficit in the final 10 minutes of a match were 0-17-1,963.

""It was a spectacular comeback,"" Xavi said in a news conference after Barça, unbeaten through six LaLiga games this season, moved top of the league ahead of Real Madrid's game against Atletico Madrid on Sunday.

""We really believed until the end. We played with faith and courage. It was a comeback born from a will to win. When you don't play well, you need these qualities.

""We were taking more and more risks, leaving two at the back, everyone else on the pitch was an attacking player. We had to take risks and it came off.

""This shows the generational change we see in society. [The players] don't give up, 2-0 down, at home, but this generation fights until the end.

""Gavi, [Alejando] Balde, Lamine [Yamal] ... today is a massive point of inflexion for our winning character. We have not played good football, but it's about epic character and faith.""

Celta had led through a first half strike from Jörgen Strand Larsen, with Anastasios Douvikas' effort 10 minutes from time silencing the home support and seemingly sealing an unexpected win for the visitors.

However, two Lewandowski goals, set up by João Félix and then Cancelo, paved the way for a brilliant Gavi cross to create a dramatic winner for Cancelo.

Xavi singled out midfielder Gavi, who replaced the injured Frenkie de Jong in the first half, for being at the centre of the turn-around.

""If we have to personify the comeback in someone, it would be Gavi,"" the coach added. ""But this was a team effort. The [Celta] goal in the 80th minute was a hammer blow -- normally Barça don't come back from that.""

Celta could have been out of sight in the second half but for the excellence of Barça goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen, who made several important saves.

""If the game had ended 4-2 to us, people would have said it was fair,"" Celta coach Rafa Benitez said in a news conference. ""We leave with the feeling of 'not again' as has happened in other games this season when we have worked hard.

""I told the players at the end they should be angry and annoyed because we lacked purpose in the final minutes to stop the game a little and prevent the situations they created.""

Xavi conceded that despite the euphoria of the win, the performance showed Barça still have plenty to improve.

""I agree with everything [Benitez] said,"" the Barça boss added. ""We needed to compete better and show more purpose. We were not good at pressing after losing the ball. We could have lost and we will learn from that.

""The win tastes really good, but not better than [the 5-0 wins against Real] Betis and Antwerp, because that's our path. The path is those games, playing well, better ball circulation. When our intensity drops, the team suffers a lot.""

Barça's success was also tainted by an ankle sprain suffered by De Jong, with sources telling ESPN that early estimates suggest he will be out for over one month.

""We need to see after tests on Sunday,"" Xavi said. ""He is a strong player who doesn't come off lightly. If he's asked to come off, there's a reason for it. We hope it's not bad."""

Open Extended Reactions

The Portland Trail Blazers traded guard Damian Lillard to play alongside Giannis Antetokounmpo with the Milwaukee Bucks as part of a three-team deal that also included the Phoenix Suns, the teams announced Wednesday.

Portland receives Jrue Holiday, Deandre Ayton, Toumani Camara, Milwaukee's 2029 unprotected first-round draft pick and unprotected Milwaukee swap rights in 2028 and 2030, the teams said in their release.

The Suns receive Jusuf Nurkic, Grayson Allen, Nassir Little and Keon Johnson as part of the trade package.

The Blazers are expected to engage contending teams on trade talks to move Holiday, sources told ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski.

The deal comes months after Lillard formally requested to be traded in early July as the Blazers decided to take a patient approach to negotiations.

Lillard leaves Portland after 11 seasons in which he made seven All-Star and All-NBA teams and led the franchise to the playoffs eight times, including a Western Conference finals appearance in 2018-19. He ranks first in team history in points and 3-pointers and second in assists.

He took to X on Wednesday to say he is ""excited"" for the next chapter.

Lillard, 33, had a career year last season, averaging 32.2 points and 7.3 assists but played just 58 games as he sat out the final month. The highlight of Lillard's season came Feb. 26 against the Houston Rockets, when he scored 71 points.

""Today is an exciting day for Milwaukee,"" Bucks president Peter Feigin and general manager Jon Horst said in a statement. ""When you have the rare opportunity to pair one of the premier NBA players with a highly versatile roster that has lofty goals, you go for it. And we're thrilled to welcome seven-time All-Star Damian Lillard to the Bucks.""

Lillard's 32.2 points per game is the most by a player to change teams the following season, according to ESPN Stats & Information.

""His character, competitiveness, talent and experience complement our group and gives us the best chance to win at the very highest level as we create new memories together,"" Horst said.

Despite Lillard's numbers, Portland failed to make the playoffs for the second consecutive season for the first time in his career. The Blazers elected to keep their draft pick after both seasons, most recently selecting guard Scoot Henderson with the No. 2 overall pick. Lillard's trade request came shortly after.

""I want to express my gratitude to Damian for 11 storied years with this franchise and for his loyalty to the Portland community,"" Blazers general manager Joe Cronin said. ""From becoming the all-time leading points scorer in franchise history to his dedicated commitment to youth across Oregon and the entire Pacific Northwest, Damian is and will remain a titan and a true trailblazer to this city.""

The Bucks emerged as the consensus favorite to win the NBA title after the trade, with odds around 4-1 at U.S. sportsbooks. Milwaukee had been listed as the fourth favorite, behind the defending champion Denver Nuggets, Boston Celtics and Suns.

The Associated Press contributed to this report."

When news of Damian Lillard's trade to the Milwaukee Bucks hit Adrian Wojnarowski's social media on Wednesday afternoon, there was a mad dash across NBA front offices to get into meetings and Zoom calls.

Not to discuss Lillard's fit with Giannis Antetokounmpo, delicious of a topic as that might be, but because the three-team trade with the Portland Trail Blazers and Phoenix Suns opened a massive opportunity: 33-year-old All-Star guard Jrue Holiday might be on the open market.

Milwaukee's pending superstar duo no doubt is the foundation of a potential championship team, but Holiday could end up playing an even bigger role as to who might win the title this season. This is one of the rarest transactions you see in the NBA: a league-altering trade that begets another possible league-altering trade.

The Trail Blazers just spent three months trying to squeeze together a deal for Lillard. It will be much easier to trade Holiday if, as is expected, they go forward with a youth movement and focus on assembling draft capital and move him onward.

That is not because Holiday is a ""better"" player than Lillard, who is one of the greatest offensive players of this generation. But because Holiday's skill set -- he's a voracious defender coming off one of the best offensive seasons of his 14-year career -- is so desired by contenders in the league. That he's got championship experience and can play a variety of different roles only makes him more valuable on a star-laden team.

All of the teams that showed interest in Lillard could call the Blazers back to re-engage on Holiday. Plus many more."
409,2023/09/27, 'mira sorvino',https://people.com/who-is-christopher-backus-mira-sorvino-husband-7974281,"Mira Sorvino and her husband Christopher Backus have been married for nearly two decades and have four children together.

Sorvino and Backus are very private when it comes to their family life. However, Backus occasionally shares glimpses of their relationship on Instagram, posting family photos and tributes to his wife.

In a 2009 interview with PEOPLE, Sorvino was asked what her hopes and dreams are for her family. ""That we grow and learn from and love each other more with every day,"" the Romy and Michele's High School Reunion alum said.

Most recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the Dancing with the Stars contestant opened up about how it brought her loved ones closer. “One of the weirdly good things about quarantine was that we did start spending a ton of time together as a family,” she said in October 2021.

So who is Mira Sorvino’s husband? Here’s everything to know about Christopher Backus and his relationship with the actress.

He’s an actor

Like Sorvino, Backus works in the entertainment industry. He’s an actor who has appeared in several notable TV shows during his career. His first few acting jobs featured him in Will & Grace and The O.C. He went on to land roles in movies like All In, Yellow Rock and Among Friends.

Backus has also had small appearances in It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia, Sons of Anarchy, Workaholics, Big Little Lies and Mindhunter. He’s well-known for portraying Jasper in 2014’s Deliverance Creek, a TV film produced by Nicholas Sparks.

Backus later starred in some films alongside Sorvino, like Indiscretion and Mothers and Daughters.

They got married in 2004

Sorvino and Backus quietly got married only about a year after they started dating. They tied the knot in a Santa Barbara courthouse on June 11, 2004.

They later had a second ceremony in Capri, Italy. In March 2022, Sorvino talked about the second destination wedding during an interview with The New York Times, saying they picked the spot after being invited to Capri’s film festival.

“I had already had this dream of having a wedding on, like, a rocky promontory overlooking the ocean. I thought maybe I could achieve that in America,” she said. “But I just fell in love with Capri. It was a way of inviting all of my ancestral ghosts to join us at the wedding.”

She added that they went back to the same spot for their 15-year anniversary to renew their vows with their kids there.

Following their nuptials, Sorvino and Backus welcomed their first child, a daughter named Mattea Angel Backus, on Nov. 3, 2004. The couple celebrated the arrival of their second child, a son named Johnny Christopher King Backus, on May 29, 2006. Their second son, Holden Backus, followed a few years later on June 22, 2009, while the couple's youngest daughter, Lucia Backus, rounded out the family with her arrival on May 3, 2012.

Sorvino struggled with pregnancy complications and a difficult delivery when giving birth to Holden, and has credited Backus as being extremely helpful throughout the whole ordeal.

“Because of my husband and my children, I feel like the luckiest woman in the world, and I just want to cherish every minute we have together,” Sorvino told PEOPLE in a 2009 interview.

Date nights are important to him

Both Sorvino and Backus are dedicated to keeping the spark alive in their relationship, even as they near their 20 year wedding anniversary. In a 2021 interview with PEOPLE, Sorvino said one of the most important ways they do this is by prioritizing quality time together.

“Date nights are absolutely essential when you have four children, because so much of your time is spent parenting,” she said. ""You're next to each other, but you're relating to your kids, rather than to each other.""

The Shining Vale star shared that they frequently enjoy evenings on their own. “We’ll go to a hotel somewhere,” she said. “This is our ritual.” Sorvino revealed that they usually head to spots in California, like Pasadena, downtown Los Angeles, Beverly Hills or Venice Beach to get dinner.

“So that we get to be a couple, not a couple with children, just for a moment. That’s really important,” she concluded.

Sorvino is an advocate for sexual abuse victims, as she helped to spearhead the #MeToo campaign with her allegations against Harvey Weinstein.

In January 2021, Deadline reported that Backus would be working alongside Sorvino on her latest project: a docuseries meant to help the survivors of human trafficking. Sorvino and Backus are set to work with her sister, Amanda, an animal advocate.

The trio and a team of therapeutic experts will lend a hand on a family-run 200-acre ranch outside of Los Angeles. The show's concept aims to help a group of people get past their trauma using expert-led animal therapy.

He and Sorvino encourage each other's careers

In a 2014 Ask Me Anything on Reddit, Backus answered questions sent in by fans. One of the inquiries was about how he and Sorvino make their relationship work around their schedules.

“It's all about support, respect and love and then the rest of it you just figure out,” he explained. “Our profession has obvious benefits in that we don't work everyday so we get to be hands on parents and that's important to both of us.”

Backus then shared that it gets “intense” when they work because of the long days, but they’re supportive of each other and take turns staying with their kids. “We're lucky to have found each other and were extremely happy about that so everything else we just figure out a way,” he added.

He’s very supportive of his family

One look at Backus’ Instagram page reveals his appreciation for his wife and kids. He posts images of Sorvino, and although he doesn’t share a lot about his kids, he sometimes uploads pictures of them too.

In May 2021, he posted a photo of Sorvino and their children playing in a backyard on Instagram, with the caption, “Happy Mother’s Day to the best mom and wife a man could ask for. She fills our lives with boundless love, affection, cuteness, adventures and bravery. So lucky are we to have you in our lives.”

The year prior, he dedicated a birthday tribute to her as well on Instagram, sharing a snap of them snuggling alongside the caption, “Every second of every day with you is a blessing from God. Happy birthday my love.”

In a 2009 interview with PEOPLE about her rough pregnancy with her third child, Sorvino praised Backus for always being there for them. “Chris was a true hero while I was in the hospital, taking care of every aspect of our lives and attending to all of the kids needs during a truly difficult time for all of us,” she said.

Real Madrid bounced back from their painful derby loss with a 2-0 home LaLiga win over lowly Las Palmas on Wednesday thanks to goals from Brahim Díaz and Joselu.

Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti made five changes to the starting side outclassed by Atletico Madrid 3-1 on Sunday, resting LaLiga's top scorer Jude Bellingham and giving new recruit Diaz his first start of the season.

- Stream on ESPN+: LaLiga, Bundesliga, more (U.S.)

The hosts were by far superior side but squandered more than a dozen clear-cut chances in the first half, with Diaz and Joselu missing sitters from close range.

They were also frustrated by goalkeeper Álvaro Valles who made a number of fine saves before Diaz broke the deadlock with a close-range strike deep into first-half stoppage time.

Substitute Lucas Vázquez, on for the injured David Alaba, delivered a low cross from inside the box to Diaz who unleashed an unstoppable strike into the top corner of the net.

Alaba added to Madrid's injury woes with Thibaut Courtois and Éder Militão probably out for the rest of the season.

Arda Güler, who was expected to be available against Las Palmas after recovering from a knee operation, sustained a thigh injury in training that will further delay his debut for the team.

However, there was better news with Brazil attacker Vinícius Júnior making his return off the bench after a month out, while Ferland Mendy returned to the starting lineup and Dani Carvajal was an unused substitute.

""We'll think about the good side, which is we've got Mendy back, we'll get Carvajal back. Rudiger had a knock,"" Ancelotti said. ""He thinks he'll be fine for Saturday. Alaba won't be there, he has an abductor problem, and we'll see over the next few days what we can do for Saturday.""

He added: ""For now we have Rudiger and Nacho, who finished today, let's see how they recover. Marvel from the academy has trained with us, [Álvaro] Carrillo, they're very good. Right now we don't have another option. Let's see. I think Rudiger will be fine.""

Joselu extended Real's lead in the 54th minute, nodding a lobbed cross from Rodrygo into the net and the hosts comfortably closed out victory.

""We created a lot of chances. I think we should have scored more but we played a very complete game and after a defeat it's always nice to win, especially at home,"" Diaz told Movistar Plus.

Madrid moved up to second place on 18 points, leapfrogging third-placed Barcelona who were held to a 2-2 draw by Mallorca on Tuesday.

Girona are the surprise leaders on 19 points after they fought back to win 2-1 at Villarreal on Wednesday and remain unbeaten after seven games of the LaLiga season."
412,2023/09/28,'michael gambon',https://www.cnn.com/2023/09/28/entertainment/michael-gambon-death-scli-intl/index.html,"CNN —

Actor Michael Gambon, best known for playing Albus Dumbledore in most of the “Harry Potter” movies, has died at 82 following a “bout of pneumonia,” a statement issued on behalf of his family said on Thursday, PA Media news agency reported.

“We are devastated to announce the loss of Sir Michael Gambon,” the statement issued by his publicist Clair Dobbs said, according to PA.

“Beloved husband and father, Michael died peacefully in hospital with his wife Anne and son Fergus at his bedside, following a bout of pneumonia. Michael was 82.”

“We ask that you respect our privacy at this painful time and thank you for your messages of support and love.”

Gambon was known for his extensive catalog of work across TV, film and radio, with another of his biggest roles as the psoriasis-ridden sleuth in the 1980s hit series “The Singing Detective.”

One of the leading thespians of his generation, Gambon was born in Cabra, Dublin, but moved to London as a child. He grew up in an Irish immigrant community in Camden and his first job was as an apprentice toolmaker. He developed a passion for antique guns, clocks and classic cars that lasted a lifetime.

“I’ve always been an obsessive collector of things,” he told a Guardian interviewer in 2004. “Richard Briers collects stamps. I collect cars and guns, which are much more expensive, and much more difficult to store.”

While apprenticing as a toolmaker, Gambon studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art, making his professional stage debut in Dublin’s the Gate Theatre production of “Othello” (1962).

He caught the attention of actor Laurence Olivier, who hired him to join the newly-formed National Theatre Company. Four years later, Gambon joined the Birmingham Repertory Company, finally playing title roles in his favorite Shakespearean plays.

It wasn’t until the 1980s that Gambon became a household name playing lead character Philip Marlow in the 1986 Anglo-American public television mini-series “The Singing Detective.”

In 1990 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire. Eight years later he was made a Knight Bachelor for his services to drama.

But it was as Hogwarts’ headmaster Dumbledore in the “Harry Potter” film series that Gambon will perhaps be best remembered, a role he took up following the death of Richard Harris in 2002. In all, Gambon was cast as Dumbledore for six of the eight “Harry Potter” films.

Tributes for ‘legend’

Rupert Grint, who played Ron Weasley in the series, paid tribute to Gambon in a post on Instagram.

“So sad to hear about Michael. He brought so much warmth and mischief to every day on set,” wrote Grint. “He captivated me as a kid and became a personal role model of mine for finding the fun and eccentricities in life.”

James Phelps, who played Ron’s brother Fred Weasley in the “Harry Potter” film franchise, posted a tribute to Gambon on X, formerly known as Twitter, Thursday.

“Very sorry to hear about the passing of Michael Gambon. He was, on and off the camera, a legend,” wrote Phelps.

“He was always very funny and very welcoming to share any knowledge he had,” Phelps added, detailing a fond memory he had working with the veteran actor between takes on the sixth “Harry Potter” movie.

And Fiona Shaw, who played Potter’s aunt Petunia Dursley in the movies, told the BBC that Gambon “varied his career remarkably.”

Shaw also said Gambon was a “gun maker” who always said “he could fool the V&A [museum] into believing that they were 18th century guns.”

“So I will think of him as a trickster, just a brilliant, magnificent trickster, but with text there was nothing like him, he could do anything.”

Helen Mirren also paid tribute to Gambon in an interview with the BBC, recalling his sense of humor.

“Naughty but very, very funny,” she said. “He kept me constantly in laughter.”

Mirren also called Gambon an “instinctive actor” who made an “extraordinary contribution to the British landscape of theater.”

Over the course of his career, Gambon won multiple Best Actor awards at the British Academy Television Awards (BAFTAs) and was nominated for two Emmy awards."

The Boston Red Sox say Tim Wakefield is undergoing treatment for an unspecified disease and asked fans to respect the former pitcher's privacy after his illness was disclosed without his consent by ex-teammate Curt Schilling.

The Red Sox issued a statement Thursday after Schilling discussed Wakefield's condition on a podcast, leading to an outpouring of support for Wakefield -- and criticism of Schilling.

""We are aware of the statements and inquiries about the health of Tim and Stacy Wakefield,"" the Red Sox said. ""Unfortunately, this information has been shared publicly without their permission. Their health is a deeply personal matter they intended to keep private as they navigate treatment and work to tackle this disease. Tim and Stacy are appreciative of the support and love that has always been extended to them and respectfully ask for privacy at this time.""

Wakefield, 57, retired in 2012 with a 200-192 record and 4.41 ERA in more than 3,000 major league innings. The knuckleballer was a part of Boston's 2004 and '07 World Series championships and was inducted into the team's Hall of Fame in 2016.

Wakefield also has worked for NESN, the Red Sox broadcast network, since 2012 and remained active in Boston charities, including the Red Sox Foundation.

Schilling, who was Wakefield's teammate from 2004 to '07, retired in 2009. He worked as an ESPN analyst before he was fired in 2016 for anti-transgender social media posts.

Schilling was diagnosed with throat cancer in 2014 and later said it was in remission. He was enshrined in the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2012, but he fell short of induction in the national Baseball Hall of Fame in 2022, his final year of eligibility, garnering 58.6% of the vote -- far short of the 75% needed.

Hoffman has created a partisan process designed to slow walk nominees, further his radical political agenda, and attack reproductive freedoms in his ongoing fight to ban abortion with no exceptions for rape and incest. The process is holding agencies that serve the people of Arizona hostage and wasting taxpayer dollars. The Governor’s actions will ensure that small businesses, Veterans, families and children that rely on the State for critical services can continue to count on the leadership they deserve.



“Extremist Jake Hoffman is more interested in using his committee to pursue his radical political agenda than give a fair hearing to Governor Hobbs’ cabinet nominees,” said Hobbs Communications Director Christian Slater. “Time and again Governor Hobbs has worked in good faith with the committee to have nominees fairly reviewed, but Hoffman has refused. It’s time to put an end to the political circus that puts Hoffman’s radical agenda first at the expense of everyday Arizonans.”



Hobbs has withdrawn her nominees after the State Senate failed to act in good faith to review and confirm nominees in a timely manner. At the current pace, Hoffman wouldn’t finish his job, and will be holding nomination hearings well into Governor Hobbs’ second term.



Hobbs also indicated a willingness to resume sending nominees for Senate review if the Senate returns to the regular confirmation process in which both parties have participated throughout State history. In the meantime, withdrawn nominees will serve as Executive Deputy Directors of their respective agencies.

The Hogan Knows Best reality star posted a lengthy letter on Instagram to clear up some misconceptions about why she chose not to attend her father’s nuptials to Sky Daily last week, suggesting that it all came down to their new family ""dynamics.""

Brooke, 35, started off her post noting that despite valuing her “privacy,” she wanted to address the matter and “shut it all down here” instead of “leaving it to speculation.”

“As we all experience this with our own families, the dynamics of a family unit continuously change over the years,” the singer and entrepreneur wrote in her post on Instagram.

“With that being said, my family has experienced a LOT of change,” she continued. “With all of it happening in the public eye, I’ve had to learn how to best navigate those changes as they come, which has been difficult to say the least.”

Brooke Hogan's letter posted on Instagram. Brooke Hogan Instagram

Hulk, 70, and first wife Linda Hogan — Brooke’s mom — were married from 1983 to 2009. They also share son Nick, 33. The former professional wrestler then wed Jennifer McDaniel in 2010, but filed for divorce in October 2021 before he began dating Daily.



“For my own journey to healing and happiness, I have chosen to create some distance between myself and my family, and am focusing on people and things that heal my heart and align with my own personal beliefs, goals and values,” Brooke went on.

She concluded the post, “I wish him well. ❤️”

The retired WWE star, whose real name is Terry Bollea, tied the knot with Daily, a yoga instructor, in a small ceremony on Friday in Clearwater, Florida, according to TMZ.

In photos obtained by the outlet, Hulk and his new bride posed for photos together after the ceremony, with him in a simple black tuxedo and a black version of his signature bandana and Daily, 45, in a glittery white strapless gown with a sweetheart neckline and lace train.

Brooke has supported her father in the past and even defended him after he faced major backlash in 2015 following the release of an audio transcript featuring him using racial slurs when talking about her then-boyfriend. As a result, Hulk parted ways with the WWE at the time and was removed from its Hall of Fame. (He was later reinstated, following a three-year suspension.)

""I realized this behavior and this type of verbiage is unacceptable. So for me to digress and say something so foul is devastating,"" Hulk, who retired from the WWE in 2021, told PEOPLE in 2015.

Brooke also told PEOPLE at the time that she forgave her father for his actions.

“What he said was not right, but I know that’s not who he is,” she said. “He has told me that he made some really bad choices, but that it never changed that I was his baby girl and he loved me and be would lost without his kids.”

Brooke added, “Maybe the positive of this whole situation is shedding light on the need to eliminate hateful words from our vocabulary altogether."""

The Lions are 2-point favorites, according to our friends at DraftKings Sportsbook, and the total is set at 45.5 points.

I’m eager to see what Green Bay’s offense looks like at full strength. Pro Bowl running back Aaron Jones registered 28 snaps in the season opener before pulling up with a hamstring injury and has been out since; 2022 second-round pick Christian Watson has yet to play this year, also due to a hamstring injury. Both players are expected to return tonight to a Packers offense that already ranks sixth in Expected Points Added per play.

For the Lions, I will be pretending that I do not see the incredible play of rookie safety Brian Branch, who was rumored to be a potential Jaguars draft target in April.

418,2023/09/29, 'feinstein',https://apnews.com/article/dianne-feinstein-dead-c831f3228ac44faa9653234570bb8ce9,"WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California, a centrist Democrat and champion of liberal causes who was elected to the Senate in 1992 and broke gender barriers throughout her long career in local and national politics, has died. She was 90.

Feinstein died on Friday morning at her home in Washington, D.C., her office said. Tributes poured in all day. Opening the Senate floor, Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced that “we lost a giant in the Senate.”

“As the nation mourns this tremendous loss, we know how many lives she impacted and how many glass ceilings she shattered along the way,” Schumer said, his voice cracking.

President Joe Biden, who served with Feinstein for years in the Senate, called her “a pioneering American,” a “true trailblazer” and a “cherished friend.”

California Gov. Gavin Newsom will appoint a temporary replacement, and there is sure to be a spirited battle to succeed her.

Feinstein, the oldest sitting U.S. senator, was a passionate advocate for liberal priorities important to her state -- including environmental protection, reproductive rights and gun control -- but was also known as a pragmatic lawmaker who reached out to Republicans and sought middle ground.

Her death came after a bout of shingles sidelined her for more than two months earlier this year — an absence that drew frustration from her most liberal critics and launched an unsuccessful attempt by Democrats to temporarily replace her on the Senate Judiciary Committee. When she returned to the Senate in May, she was frail and using a wheelchair, voting only occasionally.

On Friday, her Senate desk was draped in black and topped with a vase of white roses. Senators gave tearful tributes as members of the California House delegation stood in the back of the chamber and former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sat in the gallery with Feinstein’s daughter, Katherine.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell was one of several Republicans who gave tributes to the Democratic icon, calling her his friend. “Dianne was a trailblazer, and her beloved home state of California and our entire nation are better for her dogged advocacy and diligent service,” McConnell said.

Biden said in a statement, “Dianne made her mark on everything from national security to the environment to protecting civil liberties. “Our country will benefit from her legacy for generations.”

Former president Barack Obama also saluted her as “a trailblazer,” and former President Bill Clinton called her a champion “of civil rights and civil liberties, environmental protection and strong national security.”

She was elected to the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1969 and became its first female board president in 1978, the year Mayor George Moscone was gunned down alongside Supervisor Harvey Milk at City Hall by Dan White, a disgruntled former supervisor. Feinstein found Milk’s body.

After Moscone’s death, Feinstein became San Francisco’s first female mayor. In the Senate, she was one of California’s first two female senators, the first woman to head the Senate Intelligence Committee and the first woman to serve as the Judiciary Committee’s top Democrat.

Although Feinstein was not always embraced by the feminist movement, her experiences colored her outlook through her five decades in politics.

“I recognize that women have had to fight for everything they have gotten, every right,” she told The Associated Press in 2005, as the Judiciary Committee prepared to hold hearings on President George W. Bush’s nomination of John Roberts to replace Sandra Day O’Connor on the Supreme Court.

“So I must tell you, I try to look out for women’s rights. I also try to solve problems as I perceive them, with legislation, and reaching out where I can, and working across the aisle,” she said.

Feinstein’s bipartisan efforts helped her notch legislative wins throughout her career. But it also proved to be a liability in her later years in Congress, as her state became more liberal and as the Senate and the electorate became increasingly polarized.

A fierce debater who did not suffer fools, the California senator was long known for her verbal zingers and sharp comebacks when challenged on the issues about which she was most fervent. But she lost that edge in her later years in the Senate, as her health visibly declined and she sometimes became confused when answering questions or speaking publicly. In February 2023, she said she would not run for a sixth term the next year. And within weeks of that announcement, she was absent for the Senate for more than two months as she recovered from a bout of shingles.

Amid the concerns about her health, Feinstein stepped down as the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel after the 2020 elections, just as her party was about to take the majority. In 2023, she said she would not serve as the Senate president pro tempore, or the most senior member of the majority party, even though she was in line to do so. The president pro tempore opens the Senate every day and holds other ceremonial duties.

One of Feinstein’s most significant legislative accomplishments was early in her career, when the Senate approved her amendment to ban manufacturing and sales of certain types of assault weapons as part of a crime bill that President Bill Clinton signed into law in 1994. Though the assault weapons ban expired 10 years later and was never renewed or replaced, it was a poignant win after her career had been significantly shaped by gun violence.

Feinstein remembered finding Milk’s body, her finger slipping into a bullet hole as she felt for a pulse. It was a story she would retell often in the years ahead as she pushed for stricter gun control measures.

She had little patience for Republicans and others who opposed her on that issue, though she was often challenged. In 1993, during debate on the assault weapons ban, Sen. Larry Craig, R-Idaho, accused her of having an insufficient knowledge of guns and the gun control issue.

Feinstein spoke fiercely of the violence she’d lived through in San Francisco and retorted: ''Senator, I know something about what firearms can do.”

Two decades later, after 20 children and six educators were killed in a horrific school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, first-term Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas similarly challenged Feinstein during debate on legislation that would have permanently banned the weapons.

“I’m not a sixth grader,” Feinstein snapped back at the much younger Cruz — a moment that later went viral. She added: “It’s fine you want to lecture me on the Constitution. I appreciate it. Just know I’ve been here a long time.”

Feinstein became mayor of San Francisco after the 1978 slayings of Moscone and Milk, leading the city during one of the most turbulent periods in its history. Even her critics credited Feinstein with a calming influence, and she won reelection on her own to two four-year terms.

With her success and growing recognition statewide came visibility on the national political stage.

In 1984, Feinstein was viewed as a vice presidential possibility for Walter Mondale but faced questions about the business dealings of her husband, Richard Blum. In 1990, she used news footage of her announcement of the assassinations of Moscone and Milk in a television ad that helped her win the Democratic nomination for California governor, making her the first female major-party gubernatorial nominee in the state’s history.

Although she narrowly lost the general election to Republican Pete Wilson, the stage was set for her election to the Senate two years later to fill the Senate seat Wilson had vacated to run for governor.

Feinstein campaigned jointly with Barbara Boxer, who was running for the state’s other U.S. Senate seat, and both won, benefiting from positive news coverage and excitement over their historic race. California had never had a female U.S. senator, and female candidates and voters had been galvanized by the Supreme Court hearings in which the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee questioned Anita Hill about her sexual harassment allegations against nominee Clarence Thomas.

Feinstein was appointed to the Judiciary panel and eventually the Senate Intelligence Committee, becoming the chairperson in 2009. She was the first woman to lead the intelligence panel, a high-profile perch that gave her a central oversight role over U.S. intelligence controversies, setbacks and triumphs, from the killing of Osama bin Laden to leaks about National Security Agency surveillance.

Under Feinstein’s leadership, the intelligence committee conducted a wide-ranging, five-year investigation into CIA interrogation techniques during President George W. Bush’s administration, including waterboarding of terrorism suspects at secret overseas prisons. The resulting 6,300-page “torture report” concluded among other things that waterboarding and other “enhanced interrogation techniques” did not provide key evidence in the hunt for bin Laden. A 525-page executive summary was released in late 2014, but the rest of the report has remained classified.

The Senate investigation was full of intrigue at the time, including documents that mysteriously disappeared and accusations traded between the Senate and the CIA that the other was stealing information. The drama was captured in a 2019 movie about the investigation called “The Report,” and actor Annette Bening was nominated for a Golden Globe for her portrayal of Feinstein.

In the years since, Feinstein has continued to push aggressively for eventual declassification of the report.

“It’s my very strong belief that one day this report should be declassified,” Feinstein said. “This must be a lesson learned: that torture doesn’t work.”

Feinstein sometimes frustrated liberals by adopting moderate or hawkish positions that put her at odds with the left wing of the Democratic Party, as well as with the more liberal Boxer, who retired from the Senate in 2017. Feinstein defended the Obama administration’s expansive collection of Americans’ phone and email records as necessary for protecting the country, for example, even as other Democratic senators voiced protests. “It’s called protecting America,” Feinstein said then.

That tension escalated during Donald Trump’s presidency, when many Democrats had little appetite for compromise. Feinstein became the top Democrat on the Judiciary panel in 2016 and led her party’s messaging through three Supreme Court nominations -- a role that angered liberal advocacy groups that wanted to see a more aggressive partisan in charge.

Feinstein closed out confirmation hearings for Justice Amy Coney Barrett with an embrace of Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and a public thanks to him for a job well done. “This has been one of the best set of hearings that I’ve participated in,” Feinstein said at the end of the hearing.

Liberal advocacy groups that had fiercely opposed Barrett’s nomination to replace the late liberal icon Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg were furious and called for her to step down from the committee leadership.

A month later, Feinstein announced she would remain on the committee but step down as the top Democrat. The senator, then 87 years old, did not say why. In a statement, she said she would “continue to do my utmost to bring about positive change in the coming years.”

Feinstein was born on June 22, 1933. Her father, Leon Goldman, was a prominent surgeon and medical school professor in San Francisco, but her mother was an abusive woman with a violent temper that was often directed at Feinstein and her two younger sisters.

Feinstein graduated from Stanford University in 1955, with a bachelor’s degree in history. She married young and was a divorced single mother of her daughter, Katherine, in 1960, at a time when such a status was still unusual.

In 1961, Feinstein was appointed by then-Gov. Pat Brown to the women’s parole board, on which she served before running for the San Francisco Board of Supervisors. Typical of the era, much of the early coverage of her entrance into public life focused on her appearance rather than her experience and education.

Feinstein’s second husband, Bert Feinstein, was 19 years older than she, but she described the marriage as “a 10"" and kept his name even after his death from cancer in 1978. In 1980, she married investment banker Richard Blum, and thanks to his wealth, she was one of the richest members of the Senate. He died in February 2022.

In addition to her daughter, Feinstein has a granddaughter, Eileen, and three stepchildren.

For 27 years, the family of Tupac Shakur has been waiting for justice. We are here today to announce the arrest of 60-year-old Duane Keith Davis, a.k.a., Keithy D. for the murder of Tupac Shakur. Davis was arrested this morning by my L.V.M.P.D. Criminal Apprehension team, and this investigation started on the night of September 7th, 1996. It is far from over.” “Prior to September 7th of 1996, as we all know, Tupac Shakur was an artist who was signed with death Row Records. And that death Row Records and its CEO, Marion Suge Knight, were closely affiliated with the Mob Piru criminal street gangs, and that they had an ongoing feud with the South side, Compton Crips. Duane Davis was the leader and shot caller of the South side, Compton Crips. And both of these gangs operated out of the Southern California area of Compton. On the night of September 7th of 1996, Tupac Shakur, along with Suge Knight and members of their entourage, which include members of Mob Piru, came to Vegas to attend the Mike Tyson fight at the MGM Grand Garden Arena. Members of the South Side Compton crips, which included Duane Davis, along with his nephew, Orlando Anderson, were also in attendance at the same event as both were leaving the fight. Members of Death Row Records spotted Orlando Anderson near an elevator bank inside the MGM, and at that time they began to kick and punch him near that elevator bank. And on this incident, you will see Tupac Shakur, who is wearing a shiny satiny shirt along with Marion Suge knight, who is a large man in a Brown suit punching and kicking Orlando Anderson. Following this incident, you’ll see hotel security intervene. And then they will leave the area of the fight. Following this incident, Tupac and Suge Knight both left the MGM to make their way to a post fight party, which was to occur at a local nightclub. At the same time, word had spread amongst members of the Southside Compton Crips of what had occurred inside the MGM. And then that’s when Duane Davis began to devise a plan to obtain a firearm and retaliate against shug Knight and Mr Shakur for what occurred inside the hotel against Mr. Anderson. After Davis obtained a gun, he entered into a white Cadillac, along with Terrence brown, DeAndre Smith and Orlando Anderson. Based on our investigation, this is where we know they were seated. At some point in time, as they were in the White Cadillac. Mr Davis took the gun that he had obtained and provided it to the passengers in the rear seat of the vehicle as they were both, as they were driving West on Flamingo Road near cobalt. They located the Black BMW, which was driven by Suge Knight. And in the passenger seat was Tupac Shakur. And as they turned around, they pulled up near the passenger side of that vehicle and immediately began shooting at Mr. Knight and Mr. Shakur. Following that shooting, the White Cadillac fled the area southbound on cobalt. And as our after our officers arrived on scene, Tupac was later transported to the University Medical center, where he’s treated medically and died approximately six days later on September 13."

Toby Keith is giving supporters an update on his health.

The country star, who revealed in 2022 he was diagnosed with stomach cancer, said is he feeling “pretty good.”

“It’s a little bit of a roller coaster. You get good days and, you know, you’re up and down, up and gown. It’s always zero to 60 and 60 to zero but I feel good today,” the singer told E! News on Thursday.

Keith received the Country Icon Award at the People’s Choice Country Awards on Thursday night.

“Bet you thought you’d never see me in skinny jeans,” he joked when he took the stage to accept the award. “I want to thank the almighty for allowing me to be here tonight. You’ve been riding shotgun with me for a little while.”

He also performed “Don’t Let the Old Man In.”

Keith released his debut album in 1993 and is known for hits including “Red Solo Cup” and “I Wanna Talk About Me.”"
421,2023/09/29, 'flash flood warning',https://www.nytimes.com/live/2023/09/29/nyregion/nyc-rain-flash-flooding,"Pinned

Heavy rainfall pounded New York City and the surrounding region on Friday, bringing flash floods, shutting down entire subway lines, turning major roadways into lakes and sending children to the upper floors of flooding schoolhouses. Gov. Kathy Hochul declared a state of emergency, urging New Yorkers to stay home and singling out those who live in basements to brace for the worst.

State and city leaders implored residents not to underestimate a storm that flipped from falling rain to fire-hose torrents in minutes. Ms. Hochul called it a “life-threatening rainfall event,” and Mayor Eric Adams called the storm “something that we cannot take lightly and we are not taking lightly.” The city’s residents, while largely caught by surprise, took heed and many stayed home and off the roads.

Citywide cellphone pings pushed alerts from the National Weather Service throughout the day, repeatedly extending a “considerable” flash-flood warning, a level reserved for extreme and rare rainfall events.

The warning remained in effect through the evening, and the governor cautioned at a news conference against driving despite a lull in the storm. The rain was unpredictable, she said, and it wasn’t entirely clear what areas would be hardest hit overnight.

Throughout the day, cascading waterfalls shut down subway lines across much of the city, with service being halted even at major hubs like Barclays Center. Trains were rerouted with little warning.

“I have no idea what’s happening,” one subway conductor said as her Q train moved onto the E line. “I don’t know where we’re going.”

Commuters turned and ventured back home on foot through scenes of chaos and upheaval.

Water gushed into brownstone basements in Park Slope. In Prospect Park, the landscape was altered by new creeks. In Queens, the storm was generational, making Friday the wettest day at Kennedy International Airport since modern record-keeping began.

The streets in Windsor Terrace in Brooklyn, a neighborhood built on the slant of a hill, were engulfed in minutes in currents dotted with whitecaps, just as schools were opening their doors. Boys and girls slogged through deep water on 11th Avenue to reach their elementary school classes while neighbors with rakes tried to clear storm drains of dense fallen leaves.

“No children are in danger as far as we know,” the governor said. But some schools asked parents to return during the storm to pick up their children, which school officials later said was “precisely the wrong thing to do.”

“Truthfully, holding school today knowing this was coming feels irresponsible,” said Jessamyn Lee, a Brooklyn parent of two.

By the end of the day, the overall attendance rate at public schools fell to roughly 77 percent, after hovering around 90 percent earlier this week. Several dozen schools across Brooklyn in particular saw more than 4 in 10 students absent.

The sense that city leaders were largely caught off guard promised to linger after the rain had stopped falling. Mayor Adams was swiftly criticized for not warning residents about the storm soon enough, and for waiting to address New Yorkers until noontime Friday.

Scenes both placid and fraught played out in the city, depending on how hard the rain was falling. Waist-high rivers appeared beneath arched bridges in Central Park. A man in a drenched business suit leaned on a fence by the Great Lawn, and removed his boots one at a time to empty them of water.

In Prospect Heights, Brooklyn, a large tree fell, pulling its roots up through a sidewalk and cleaving a parked Nissan. In Windsor Terrace, Bryn Knowles, a former city parks employee in Lake Oswego, Ore., felt her instincts from that rain-soaked region kick in. She picked up a rake and went out to a blocked drain on the corner.

“Every major rain event, all the city workers would drop all their tasks, grab their rakes and go and clear storm drains,” she said. “It’s fun — it’s instant gratification, it helps people.”

Attention immediately turned to residents who live in flood zones, two years after the remnants of Hurricane Ida caused basement floods that killed 11 people in Queens. Many of those apartments, which are often rented to immigrants or others desperate for an affordable place to live, are not allowed to be rented legally and do not have adequate means of escape in a flood.

“Plan your escape route,” Ms. Hochul said. “Don’t wait until water is over your knees before you leave. Don’t wait until it’s too late.”

The rain on Friday made this the second-wettest September in New York City history, according to National Weather Service statistics: More than a foot of rain — over 14 inches — has fallen this month, the most in more than 140 years, when the city logged 16.85 inches in September 1882.

The storm created havoc for the busiest streets and highways, flooding parts of the F.D.R. Drive and closing down the Belt Parkway. Many flights were canceled or delayed at Kennedy and La Guardia.

Over the next few hours, the storm will gradually head east, said Dominic Ramunni, a Weather Service meteorologist. “We’ve got Manhattan on the western edge of it now, with the heaviest rain over Queens and western Nassau County,” he said. But he added, “We’re still dealing with it: We still have that fire hose of moisture coming on shore.”

In the Central Park Zoo, the storm brought about an escape: The water rose so high that a female sea lion, named Sally, was able to breach her pool and venture out. She did not get far, with the zoo locked down and employees watching her carefully.

Like many New Yorkers on Friday, Sally decided she was better off at home.

“She explored the area before returning to the familiar surroundings of the pool,” said Jim Breheny, an executive with the Wildlife Conservation Society, “and the company of the other two sea lions.”

Colorado star safety Shilo Sanders is out for Saturday's game against No. 8 USC, leaving a struggling Buffaloes secondary even more vulnerable against the Trojans.

Sanders did not practice this week, sources said, and is slated to be replaced in the starting lineup by Southern Utah transfer Rodrick Ward. Coach Deion Sanders said on his radio show this week that his son had a kidney injury that was causing him to urinate blood.

Sanders is a graduate student who played at South Carolina and Jackson State before starting at Colorado this season. He has been one of Colorado's defensive linchpins, with 26 tackles while forcing a fumble and recording an 80-yard interception return in the victory over Colorado State.

The loss of Sanders leaves Colorado without two of its most valuable players, as Travis Hunter (333 snaps at WR/DB) and Sanders (312) are among the team's top three players in total snaps.

Hunter, the lockdown cornerback who moonlights at receiver, is out multiple weeks after taking an illegal hit from Colorado State's Henry Blackburn.

That leaves Colorado short-handed against returning Heisman winner Caleb Williams and a USC passing offense that ranks No. 3 nationally with 377.2 yards per game. Williams will be squaring off in a quarterback duel with Sanders' brother, Shedeur, in a game that's intriguing enough to NFL front offices that 30 scouts from 21 teams will be in attendance.

Colorado's pass defense ranks No. 111 nationally, yielding 269.2 yards per game. USC is No. 68 at 228 yards per game.

The start at safety will be a big test for Ward, a backup who has nine defensive snaps, 57 special teams snaps and three tackles this year behind Shilo Sanders on the depth chart. Sanders is one of Colorado's vocal leaders and key figures in the secondary.

According to ESPN Stats & Information, Ward has dropped into coverage on three snaps this year and wasn't targeted as a primary defender.

Colorado leading wide receiver Xavier Weaver will play Saturday. Weaver suffered an unspecified injury in last week's loss to Oregon."

The defending Heisman Trophy winner threw for over 400 yards and six touchdowns but had to sweat out the win as the Trojans defense was gashed for 27 second-half points.

But that game and all others throughout the day were topped by the late-night action. In a wild shootout in Starkville, No. 20 Ole Miss prevailed, 55-49, over No. 13 LSU in a contest that featured more than 1,300 yards of combined offense. Then No. 11 Notre Dame rallied back to beat No. 17 Duke, 21-14, in the waning seconds of a thriller in Durham. The Irish pulled off the last-gasp win just one week after a heartbreaking loss of their own.

Elsewhere on Saturday, Kentucky's Ray Davis had himself a career day in the Wildcats' upset win over No. 22 Florida, running for 280 yards and three touchdowns. No. 3 Texas had no problem handling Kansas despite a lucky Jayhawks bounce, No. 1 Georgia survived a road scare at Auburn and Ole Miss battled back to topple LSU in the waning seconds.

Week 5 of the college football season delivered in more ways than one."

Rep. Jamaal Bowman pulled a fire alarm in the Cannon House Office Building on Saturday morning, shortly before the House was scheduled to vote on a government funding bill, an incident the New York Democrat said was an accident.

The incident was first revealed by House Administration Committee Chairman Bryan Steil, a Republican from Wisconsin, who said in a statement that an investigation is underway.

Steil told CNN on Saturday evening that Bowman needed to be “far more forthcoming” about what happened when he decided to pull the fire alarm.

“We know Jamaal Bowman pulled the fire alarm. Why he did that, it is pretty unclear. His initial explanation, that it was an accident, doesn’t seem to really pass muster,” Steil told CNN’s Jim Acosta. Steil also warned that if Bowman pulled the alarm to interfere with the House voting procedure – an accusation Bowman earlier told reporters was “complete BS” – it would be “a serious violation of the law.”

Bowman’s office said it was an accident, and the congressman told reporters later Saturday: “I was trying to get to a door. I thought the alarm would open the door, and I pulled the fire alarm to open the door by accident.”

“I was just trying to get to my vote and the door that’s usually open wasn’t open, it was closed,” Bowman added.

Leadership in both parties was informed of the situation once Bowman was identified in security footage, a source familiar said.

Bowman said he met with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries about the incident shortly after the funding stopgap measure passed the House on Saturday, adding that Jeffries’ tone was “supportive” and “he understood that was a mistake.”

House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said the House Ethics Committee should look into the incident.

“I think ethics should look at this, but this is serious,” McCarthy said in response to a reporter’s question following the House vote.

He added that he will have a discussion with Jeffries regarding the incident.

“This should not go without punishment,” McCarthy said. “This is an embarrassment. You are elected to be a member of Congress. You pulled a fire alarm, in a (matter) of hours before the government being shut down, trying to dictate that the government would shut down?”

Following McCarthy’s remarks, Rep. Lisa McClain, a Michigan Republican and member of the GOP leadership team, told CNN she was circulating a resolution to censure Bowman over the incident. She said she already has co-sponsors.

Bowman, however, laughed off the GOP response to the incident on Saturday, telling reporters, “They’re gonna do what they do. This is what they do.”

Tim Wakefield, the knuckleballing workhorse of the Red Sox pitching staff who bounced back after giving up a season-ending home run to the Yankees in the 2003 playoffs to help Boston win its curse-busting World Series title the following year, has died. He was 57.

The Red Sox announced his death in a statement Sunday. Wakefield had brain cancer, according to former teammate Curt Schilling, who disclosed the illness on a podcast last week without Wakefield's consent. The Red Sox confirmed an illness at the time but did not elaborate, saying Wakefield had requested privacy.

""It's one thing to be an outstanding athlete; it's another to be an extraordinary human being. Tim was both,"" Red Sox chairman Tom Werner said in the team's statement. ""I know the world was made better because he was in it.""

Said Red Sox manager and ex-teammate Alex Cora on Sunday: ""We lost a brother, a teammate, a family member. One of the best teammates I ever had. ... Of all the guys I played with, nobody wore his jersey with more pride than Tim Wakefield.""

Our hearts are broken with the loss of Tim Wakefield.



Wake embodied true goodness; a devoted husband, father, and teammate, beloved broadcaster, and the ultimate community leader. He gave so much to the game and all of Red Sox Nation.



Our deepest love and thoughts are with... pic.twitter.com/ah5kV2Yt8j — Red Sox (@RedSox) October 1, 2023

Drafted by the Pittsburgh Pirates as a first baseman who set home run records in college, Wakefield converted to a pitcher after mastering the knuckleball in the minor leagues after learning the pitch from his father as a kid.

Wakefield told ESPN in 2011 that he learned the pitch as a boy from his father, Steve, when the two of them would play catch in the backyard at home in Melbourne, Florida.

""It was something to basically tire me out,"" Wakefield said then.

Relying on the old-timey pitch that had largely fallen into disuse, he went on to win 200 major league games, including 186 with the Red Sox -- behind only Cy Young and Roger Clemens in franchise history.

Wakefield won the Roberto Clemente Award for sportsmanship and community involvement in 2010 and was the Red Sox nominee seven other times. He was the team's first Jimmy Fund captain, visiting with patients and raising funds for the childhood cancer charity, and the honorary chairman of the Red Sox Foundation.

""He was a great man who will be dearly missed,"" the Pirates said.

But it was Wakefield's role in the Red Sox-Yankees rivalry of the early 2000s that turned him into a fan favorite whose impact went far beyond his numbers.

After New York rallied to tie Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series, Wakefield came on in relief in the 11th inning and Aaron Boone hit his first pitch for a walk-off home run to end Boston's season and extend a World Series drought that stretched back to 1918.

Said Wakefield at the time: ""I just became Bill Buckner.""

The following October, with Boston's season again at risk against the Yankees in the ALCS, Wakefield got nine outs in extra innings of Game 5, setting up David Ortiz to win it in the 14th. The Red Sox went on to complete their comeback from a 3-0 series deficit and then sweep the St. Louis Cardinals in the World Series to claim their first championship in 86 years.

The Red Sox -- and Wakefield -- won it all again in 2007.

""I can't describe what you mean to me and my family,"" Ortiz posted on social media. ""My heart is broken right now because l will never be able to replace a brother and a friend like you....Rest and peace my brother.""

Guardians manager Terry Francona, who led Boston's two championship teams, was in Detroit preparing for his retirement send-off when he heard about Wakefield. ""It's just like I got kicked in the stomach,"" Francona said.

Boone, who is now the Yankees manager, also said he was broken-hearted.

""Ah, man. Just my heart goes out to their family,"" he said. ""My thoughts to all the Red Sox organization but also around baseball, where Tim was beloved. Obviously, a sad day.""

Wakefield was 11-3 when he made his only All-Star Game in 2009, becoming the second-oldest player (Satchel Paige was the oldest) ever selected to his first Midsummer Classic. Wakefield was the oldest player in baseball at 45 when he earned his 200th win in September 2011, retiring the final six batters he faced.

He announced his retirement the following spring training, seven wins short of breaking the franchise record held by Clemens and Young.

""I'm still a competitor, but ultimately I think this is what's best for the Red Sox,"" Wakefield said at the time. ""I think this is what's best for my family. And to be honest with you, seven wins isn't going to make me a different person or a better man. So my family really needs me at home.""

An eighth-round draft pick in 1988, Wakefield converted from a first baseman to a pitcher two years later in an effort to revive his chances of making the majors. He got his call-up midway through the 1992 season and went 8-1, finishing third in the National League Rookie of the Year voting.

""I was disappointed (the Pirates) were giving up on me that quick (as a hitter),"" Wakefield said in his memoir, ""Knuckler: My Life with Baseball's Most Confounding Pitch."" ""But then, they basically told me, 'You're going to pitch or you're going to go home.' So I said, 'OK, I'll pitch.'""

He added two complete games in the NLCS -- one in Game 6 to keep Pittsburgh alive. He was voted the MVP of the series late in Game 7, before the Atlanta Braves rallied to win on Francisco Cabrera's single with two outs in the bottom of the ninth.

""[Wakefield] made his big league debut in 1992 and was a key addition to the pitching staff that helped propel the team to its third consecutive Postseason appearance,"" the Pirates said in a statement. ""Off the field, Tim always devoted his time to make an impact on others within the Pittsburgh community. He was a great man who will be dearly missed. Our thoughts and prayers are with his family at this difficult time.""

Wakefield was unable to recapture his success in his second year in Pittsburgh, going 6-11 with a 5.61 ERA. He was released by the Pirates after another trip through the minors and was signed six days later by the Red Sox.

Wakefield again strung together a dominant run, starting 14-1 in 1995 before finishing the year at 16-8 with a 2.95 ERA. After 17 seasons with Boston, he retired as the franchise leader with 3,006 innings and 430 starts and second in games and strikeouts.

In all, he was 200-180 with a 4.41 ERA, 2,156 strikeouts -- and 1,205 walks -- in 3,226 2/3 innings pitched over 627 appearances (463 starts).

Only three others played longer for the Red Sox -- Carl Yastrzemski (23), Ted Williams (19) and Dwight Evans (19). His 186 wins as a pitcher for the Red Sox ranks second in franchise history only to Roger Clemens (192).

And while his 3,006 innings pitched and 430 starts is tops among Red Sox pitchers, his nature as a knuckleballer explains why Wakefield is also No. 1 in team history home runs allowed, hits allowed, walks, wild pitches, batters hit by pitch, earned runs, losses and hits allowed.

""Tim was more than just a versatile and reliable All-Star pitcher, a highly respected teammate, and a two-time World Series champion,"" baseball Commissioner Rob Manfred said in a statement, citing ""the dedicated work he and his family did serving the communities of New England.""

Wakefield was inducted into the Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2016.

""I'm very grateful I've been able to wear this uniform for as long as I have, and reach a milestone that I thought I'd never reach, just ... very grateful,"" Wakefield said after his 200th victory in 2011.

Wakefield was also an eight-time nominee for the Roberto Clemente Award that goes to a ballplayer for exemplary sportsmanship and community involvement, winning it in 2010. Melany Duval, the Chief Philanthropy Officer at The Jimmy Fund, said Wakefield was a frequent visitor on the adult and pediatric cancer floors and met with the teen patients on their annual spring training trip.

""Tim Wakefield was a respected competitor, a generous soul and a beloved member of the baseball community for more than three decades as a player and a broadcaster,"" said MLB Players Association President Tony Clark, a Red Sox teammate in 2002. ""We at the MLBPA, along with the baseball family, mourn his loss.""

Wakefield is survived by his wife, Stacy -- who is also battling cancer -- and their children, Trevor and Brianna.

All told, he had 121 yards on the aforementioned 32 carries for an average of 3.8 yards per carry. The latter is hardly a celebratory statistic, but he was able to ground and pound the Packers, helping to propel Detroit to a 27-0 run in the first half before quelling any comeback hopes with a score with six minutes to go. According to Next Gen Stats, Montgomery battered and bruised the Packers with 113 yards after contact -- the most in a single game in his career.

""He does get better throughout the game,"" Lions quarterback Jared Goff said. ""He gets better the more he gets hit. The more that he's able to see the holes and see what's going on -- and yeah, he did get better. I think there was two types of runs like where the lane was wide open, and he was running right through them doing his thing. Then, there was runs where there wasn't much there and he kind of made something out of nothing. That's when you know your guy is in the zone a little bit.

427,2023/10/01, 'eagles game',https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401547451,"PHILADELPHIA -- — A.J. Brown saw more than a spark out of Jalen Hurts.

With the Eagles needing to channel the big-play, clutch-in-crunch time machine that powered them to the Super Bowl, Brown saw Hurts bring the heat.

“That fire,"" Brown said. “He woke up a little today.”

Hurts threw for 319 yards and hit Brown for two touchdowns, and Jake Elliott kicked a 54-yard field goal in overtime to lift Philadelphia to a 34-31 win over the Washington Commanders on Sunday for its second straight 4-0 start.

Elliott also kicked field goals of 41, 47 and 36 yards before booming the winner that sent the crowd into a frenzy.

And kept the Eagles unbeaten.

“My whole career has kind of been a rollercoaster in terms of being in different and unique and unprecedented moments, which you may call pressure and stormy and that fire,” Hurts said. “But that’s what I was born in. I feel like it’s a unique feeling being in those situations because you work so hard and you prepare so hard, and you go through so much to put yourself in a position where you’re comfortable in those moments.”

The Eagles survived a little-late game drama that put them on the brink of being upset at home by the Commanders (2-2) for the second straight season.

Hurts hit Brown for a 28-yard touchdown with 1:28 left in regulation for a 31-24 lead. Instead of killing the clock and trying for a winning field goal, the Eagles left enough time for Sam Howell to lead Washington to the tying score.

Brown was flagged for taunting on his TD, giving the Commanders a boost. Washington started on the Eagles 36 and tied it when Howell hit Jahan Dotson for a 10-yard touchdown as time expired.

Coach Ron Rivera went for the extra point and the tie on the road, a call that sent them knotted 31-all into OT.

The Commanders did nothing with the ball in OT. Hurts then converted a fourth-down sneak that pushed the Eagles to Washington’s 48-yard line and helped set up the winner.

Sparked by Brown's nine catches for 175 yards and two touchdowns, the NFC champion Eagles are 4-0 in consecutive seasons for the first time since 1992-93. A year ago, the Eagles’ 8-0 start was spoiled by a home loss to Washington.

The Commanders tried it again and led 17-13 in the third and tied it 24-24 in the fourth.

Hurts came as close as he has all season to the type of dynamic games that punctuated last season’s run to the Super Bowl. He sure knew how to connect with Brown.

Hurts and Brown are well past a brief spat on the sidelines during the home opener and are instead hooking up for game-changing scores. Hurts hit Brown in stride and the speedy receiver cut across the field and scored a go-ahead 59-yard TD in the third. The Eagles converted the 2-point conversion for a 21-13 lead.

Brown wore bright green cleats a week ago for one series against Tampa Bay before he changed to the standard footware to avoid getting fined by the league. He bucked the fashion rules again and wore highlight pink cleats — Brown says the flashy colors make it easier for his young daughter to spot him on the field — and then had Philly’s biggest highlight of the game.

After the Commanders rallied — Brian Robinson Jr.'s 15-yard score made it 24-all — the Eagles responded and Brown hauled in his score.

Howell was 29 of 41 for 290 yards.

“It was definitely a game I think we should have won and we were capable of winning it,” Howell said. “We feel like we can play a lot better and that is a good thing. We were really close against a good team.”

A week after Howell threw four interceptions and was sacked nine times, he went 13 of 17 for 161 yards in the first half behind an offensive line that gave him plenty of time to throw and take a 17-10 lead into the break.

Yes, the Commanders used ball control — they had the ball for 17 minutes in the first half — to get a 1-yard TD run from Curtis Samuel and Terry McLaurin's fumble recovery in the end zone for a 14-7 lead.

But the Eagles did their best to give away the game. They were penalized six times in the half and two were especially critical. On the game’s opening drive, linebacker Zach Cunningham was whistled for a holding penalty on third-and-11. Washington got new life and Samuel scored.

The Eagles also lined up in “ tush push ” formation at midfield on fourth down, only to have a likely first down thrown out on a holding penalty. The Eagles punted.

D'Andre Swift, who entered second in the NFL in rushing, had a 5-yard score that made it 14-7. Washington’s Joey Slye and Elliott each followed with field goals.

Elliott opened the second half with a 47-yarder that cut it to 17-13.

Then the fun really began. Eagles coach Nick Sirianni appreciated the character, trust and coolness needed for a team to pull out a win like this one.

He could just do without the frayed nerves.

“That's not good for me when we have to win in overtime,” he said. “There’s a lot of anxiety going into that.”

Commanders: DB Jartavius Martin suffered a thumb injury.

Eagles: RG Cam Jurgens suffered a foot injury.

The Jaguars (2-2) won after back-to-back losses to the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs and Houston Texans in Weeks 2 and 3. The Falcons (2-2) lost a second consecutive game.

Jaguars wide receiver Christian Kirk called the victory ""huge.""

""Winning in this league is tough,"" Kirk said. ""Especially when you're losing, it's even harder. When you get back-to-back losses, it weighs really heavy on you. It weighs heavy on the locker room, so you're just doing everything that you can to put together a performance like we did today and just be able to be able to get a win.Â

""You never take this stuff for granted, winning in the NFL. It's just great for us to get this thing back on track and get our confidence back.""

Lawrence completed 23 of 30 passes for 207 yards and one touchdown with no interceptions. His 30-yard touchdown pass to Ridley on the Jaguars' second series gave the Jaguars a seven-point lead â and marked their first lead of seven or more points since a Week 1 victory over the Indianapolis Colts.

Ridley, a first-round selection by the Falcons in the 2018 NFL Draft, joined the Jaguars in a trade from the Falcons last November. This was his first game against the Falcons. He caught two passes for 38 yards Sunday.

Kirk caught eight passes for 84 yards.

Falcons quarterback Desmond Ridder completed 19 of 31 passes for 191 yards and one touchdown with two interceptions. Rookie running back Dijon Robinson rushed for 105 yards on 14 carries, including 74 on six carries as the Falcons surged in the third quarter.

The Jaguars registered three sacks Sunday and now have eight for the season. Outside linebacker Travon Walker registered one in the first quarter with two of Allen's three sacks coming in the first half. Safety Andre Cisco also had an interception for the Jaguars, with defensive lineman Angelo Blackson recovering Allen's late sack/fumble to secure the victory."

The Bears acquired Claypool from the Steelers in a trade last season in exchange for a second-round pick that became the first selection of the second round, which Pittsburgh used to select cornerback Joey Porter Jr.

Claypool has just four receptions for 51 yards and one touchdown in three games this season, and he faced questions about his effort in Week 1. Things initially improved, with Claypool recording a TD catch in Week 2.

But after just one catch in last week's loss to the Chiefs and frustrations over an 0-3 start, Claypool told reporters this past week he was only focused on what he can control. He was asked if he feels he's being put in the best position to succeed. Claypool paused for a reported seven seconds and said, ""No.""

Sources say the reason for Claypool's deactivation was a multitude of factors, including how players are asked to operate on a daily basis and how they prepare for games.

As for Bagent, he takes over as QB2 for Nathan Peterman, who was Fields' backup for the first three games of the season. The former Shepherd QB originally signed with Chicago as an undrafted free agent for a $25,000 signing bonus. Bagent impressed in camp, but the organization wanted to give him some time to get acclimated due to the jump in competition from Division II to the NFL."

432,2023/10/02,'laphonza butler',https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/01/politics/laphonza-butler-dianne-feinstein-successor/index.html,"CNN —

California Gov. Gavin Newsom will appoint Laphonza Butler, the president of EMILY’s List, to fill the late Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein’s Senate seat, his office confirmed Sunday evening.

Butler will become the first out Black lesbian to join Congress, according to Newsom. She will also be the sole Black female senator serving in Congress and only the third in US history. Feinstein, the longest-serving female US senator in history, died last week at 90.

“I am honored to accept Gov. Newsom’s nomination to be a U.S. Senator for a state I have long called home,” Butler said in a statement Monday, adding that she is “humbled by the Governor’s trust.”

“For women and girls, for workers and unions, for struggling parents waiting for our leaders to bring opportunity back to their homes, for all of California, I’m ready to serve,” she said.

The selection of Butler, first reported by Politico, comes as Democrats hold a narrow Senate majority and uncertainty looms over New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez’s political future amid outcry from his Democratic colleagues over his federal indictment.

Butler has been the president of EMILY’s List, which works to elect Democratic women who support abortion rights, since the group’s board of directors appointed her in 2021, when she became the first woman of color to lead the organization. She previously worked at Airbnb as a director of public policy and campaigns and has a long history working in California politics, including as an adviser to Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2020 presidential campaign. But much of her background is in the labor movement, serving as a union president in California.

Several high-profile Democratic candidates launched campaigns earlier this year to succeed Feinstein, who announced in February that she would not run for reelection. They include a trio of House Democrats: Reps. Adam Schiff, a former House Intelligence chairman who is backed by former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Katie Porter, a former deputy chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus; and Barbara Lee, a former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and a member of House Democratic leadership. Also in the race are Democrat Lexi Reese, a tech executive, and Republican lawyer Eric Early, who ran unsuccessfully for state attorney general in 2022.

Newsom previously pledged to appoint a Black woman to Feinstein’s seat should the senator resign before her term’s end. Many had urged Newsom to appoint Lee, a longtime representative from Oakland and the only Black woman running for the seat, including the Congressional Black Caucus, which sent a letter to Newsom asking him to choose Lee just hours before his announcement.

But the governor said last month that he would not appoint any of the candidates currently seeking the office, though Newsom’s office said Monday that there were no conditions placed on Butler and that any decision to run for a full term would be her own.

Butler moved to Maryland in 2021 around the time she was chosen to lead EMILY’s List, public records show. She was registered to vote in Maryland in 2022, according to public records, but Newsom’s office said Monday, in response to questions about Butler’s residency, that she has re-registered to vote in California.

“As we mourn the enormous loss of Sen. Feinstein, the very freedoms she fought for – reproductive freedom, equal protection, and safety from gun violence – have never been under greater assault. Laphonza has spent her entire career fighting for women and girls and has been a fierce advocate for working people,” Newsom said in a statement on X.

This is Newsom’s second Senate appointment. After the 2020 election, the governor appointed Alex Padilla, then California’s secretary of state, to succeed Kamala Harris following her election to the vice presidency. Padilla became the first Latino senator from California, but Newsom was criticized for not choosing a Black woman, leaving the chamber without a Black female senator. He later appointed Shirley Weber, a Black woman, to succeed Padilla as secretary of state.

Padilla said in a statement he was “honored to welcome” Butler to the Senate and said she “has been a strong voice for working families, LGBTQ rights, and a champion for increasing women’s representation in politics.”

California will hold two Senate elections next November: a special election for the remaining months of Feinstein’s term until January 2025 and another for a full six-year term.

Lee, who is running for Feinstein’s seat in next year’s election, said she is “singularly focused on winning my campaign for Senate,” in a post on X.

Primaries for both races will be held in March, and, under the California system, all candidates will run on the same ballot, with the top two, regardless of party, advancing to the general election.

California also held two Senate elections for the same seat in 2022, following Padilla’s appointment. He won both races by similar margins.

Week 4 of the 2023 season concludes when the Seattle Seahawks and New York Giants square off in prime time on ""Monday Night Football.""





The Seahawks, coming off a comfortable win over the Panthers, are looking keep pace with their undefeated NFC West rival San Francisco. Geno Smith and the Seahawks have the potential to disrupt a struggling Giants defense that has allowed at least 28 points per game so far. Monday, also marks a return for Seattle to the site of their Super Bowl XLVIII win. The Seahawks are 5-0 at MetLife, including the playoffs, according to NFL Research.





The Giants were humbled in an 18-point loss to the 49ers just last week in prime time. Big Blue will look to right the ship at home, but Daniel Jones and the rest of the offense could potentially be without star running back Saquon Barkley for a second consecutive game. Barkley is doubtful to play after suffering a high ankle sprain in Week 2. Without Barkley, will the Giants offense struggle again?





Here are four things to watch for when the Seahawks visit the Giants on Monday night:

434,2023/10/02, 'russ francis',https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2023/oct/02/super-bowl-champion-russ-francis-killed-in-new-york-plane-crash,"Super Bowl champion Russ Francis has died at the age of 70 in a plane crash, his family has confirmed.

Francis was flying with Richard McSpadden, a former commander of the US Air Force Thunderbirds, on Sunday when their plane experienced an emergency shortly after takeoff from Lake Placid Airport. They were unable to make the runway while attempting to land and were both killed.

“My older brother Russ Francis was just killed in an airplane crash in Lake Placid, New York,” Francis’s brother, Ed, said in a Facebook post on Sunday. “Flying was my brother’s lifelong passion, and perhaps a fitting way for him to go. God speed to you my big brother!!”

Francis became interested in flying after his retirement from the NFL and owned Lake Placid Airways. He was also a qualified helicopter and airplane pilot.

The New England Patriots selected Francis in the first round of the 1975 draft, and he was named to the Pro Bowl on three occasions during his time with the team. In 1982, he joined the San Francisco 49ers, with whom he won a Super Bowl in January 1985. He returned to the Patriots in the 1987 season before retiring the following year.

“We are deeply saddened by the sudden and tragic loss of former New England Patriots tight end Russ Francis. Our condolences are extended to Francis’ family and friends,” said the Patriots in a statement on social media.

As well as his interest in aviation, he had spells as a professional wrestler and ran unsuccessfully for Congress in Hawaii in the early 2000s.

“He was a dynamic player on the field who had an even bigger personality off it,” said Patriots owner Robert Kraft in a statement on Monday."
435,2023/10/02, 'jimmy butler hair',https://www.nbcnews.com/news/nbcblk/jimmy-butler-new-emo-look-internet-shambles-rcna118628,"Jimmy Butler’s new “emo” hairdo is the internet’s latest obsession.

The Miami Heat player, 34, arrived to media day on Monday with straightened hair, painted fingernails and piercings — the second year in a row he chose the event to unveil a new look for the season.

“Yeah, yeah, laugh it up,” he told the room of snickering reporters. He added: “I’m very emotional right now. This is my emo state and I like this. This is me,” Butler said. “This is how I’m feeling as of late.”

With Butler rocking this look on media day, which is when players talk to reporters and take official headshots, his emo style will be featured in promotional photos all throughout the upcoming NBA season.

Social media users quickly noticed Butler’s new look and couldn’t help but equate his hairstyle to that of emo bands of the early 2000s — like Secondhand Serenade, Fall Out Boy, and Panic! at the Disco.

One post on X, formerly Twitter, featured several shots of Butler’s hair and an emoji meme of the infamous emo black hair swoop. It simply read: Cuz tonight will be the night that I will ball for yewwww,” a play on the lyrics to Secondhand Serenade’s 2008 hit “Fall For You.”

Another poster shared Butler’s official headshot, writing, “Not he went and got that… ‘CUT MY LIFE INTO PIECES; THIS IS MY LAST RESORT.’”

On Instagram, one user edited Butler’s head into the music video for “Outkast’s Hey Ya!,” in which rapper Andre 3000 rocks a short silk press. And the hairdresser responsible for Butler’s new look shared a behind-the-scenes clip of her straightening the athlete’s hair with Fall Out Boy’s “Thnks fr th Mmrs” playing in the background.

The internet has affectionately called Butler everything from “Heat Wentz” and “Ball Out Boy” to “Panic! At the Free Throw.”

Butler is seemingly fond of shaking up his looks regularly. He donned dreadlocks at last year’s media day and kept them for months, but ultimately decided that the long hairstyle may interfere with his game, so he removed them ahead of the Heat’s first preseason game, according to the Ringer.

It’s unclear how long Butler will keep his hair straightened, but social media users have some ideas. “Jimmy Butler gon sweat his press out before the end of the first quarter,” one person posted on X.

Internet users weren’t the only ones shocked by Butler’s latest stunt. Heat center Bam Adebayo told reporters that he hadn’t seen Butler in person before the day began and thought the straightened hair photos were edited with Photoshop.

“That is not real!” Adebayo said, calling the look “hilarious.”"
436,2023/10/03,'kevin mccarthy',https://apnews.com/article/mccarthy-gaetz-speaker-motion-to-vacate-congress-327e294a39f8de079ef5e4abfb1fa555,"WASHINGTON (AP) — Speaker Kevin McCarthy was voted out of the job Tuesday in an extraordinary showdown — a first in U.S. history, forced by a contingent of hard-right conservatives and throwing the House and its Republican leadership into chaos.

It’s the end of the political line for McCarthy, who has said repeatedly that he never gives up, but found himself with almost no options remaining. Neither the right-flank Republicans who engineered his ouster nor the Democrats who piled on seem open to negotiating.

McCarthy told lawmakers in the evening he would not run again for speaker, putting the gavel up for grabs. Next steps are highly uncertain with no obvious successor to lead the House Republican majority. Action is halted in the House until next week, when Republicans try to elect a new speaker.

“I may have lost this vote today, but as I walk out of this chamber I feel fortunate to have served,” McCarthy said at a press conference at the Capitol, alternating between upbeat assessment of his speakership and angry score-settling of those who ousted him.

Still, he said, “I wouldn’t change a thing.”

McCarthy’s chief rival, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, orchestrated the rare vote on the obscure “motion to vacate,” and pushed ahead swiftly into a dramatic afternoon roll call.

While McCarthy enjoyed support from most Republicans in his slim majority, eight Republican detractors — many of the same hard-right holdouts who tried to stop him from becoming speaker in January — essentially forced him out.

Stillness fell as the presiding officer gaveled the vote closed, 216-210, saying the office of the speaker “is hereby declared vacant.”

Moments later, a top McCarthy ally, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., took the gavel and, according to House rules, was named speaker pro tempore, to serve in the office until a new speaker is chosen.

The House then briskly recessed as lawmakers met privately to discuss the path forward.

It was a stunning moment for McCarthy, a punishment fueled by growing grievances but sparked by his weekend decision to work with Democrats to keep the federal government open rather than risk a shutdown.

But in many ways, McCarthy’s ouster was set in motion when, in deal-making with hard-right holdouts at the start of the year, he agreed to a series of demands — including a rules change that allowed any single lawmaker to file the motion to vacate.

As the House fell silent, Gaetz, a top ally of Donald Trump, rose to offer his motion.

Leaders tried to turn it back, but the vote was 218-208, with 11 Republicans against tabling the motion, a sign of trouble to come.

The House then opened a floor debate unseen in modern times, and Republicans argued publicly among themselves for more than an hour.

“It’s a sad day,” Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said as debate got underway, urging his colleagues not to plunge the House Republican majority “into chaos.”

But Gaetz shot back during the debate, “Chaos is Speaker McCarthy.”

As the fiery debate dragged on, many of the complaints against the speaker revolved around his truthfulness and his ability to keep the promises he has made.

Almost alone, Gaetz led his side of the floor debate, criticizing the debt deal McCarthy made with President Joe Biden and the vote to prevent a government shutdown, which conservatives opposed as they demanded steeper spending cuts.

But a long line of McCarthy supporters stood up for him, including Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a leader of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who said, “He has kept his word.” Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., waved his cellphone, saying it was “disgusting” that hard-right colleagues were fundraising off the move in text messages seeking donations.

McCarthy, of California, insisted he would not cut a deal with Democrats to remain in power — not that he could have relied on their help even if he had asked.

Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a letter to colleagues that he wants to work with Republicans, but he was unwilling to provide the votes needed to save McCarthy.

“It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War,” Jeffries said, announcing the Democratic leadership would vote for the motion to oust the speaker.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden “hopes the House will quickly elect a Speaker.” Once that happens, she said, “he looks forward to working together with them.”

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement thanking McCarthy for “what is often a thankless role.

At the Capitol, both Republicans and Democrats met privately ahead of the historic afternoon vote.

Behind closed doors, McCarthy told fellow Republicans: Let’s get on with it.

McCarthy invoked Republican Speaker Joseph Cannon, who more than 100 years ago confronted his critics head-on by calling their bluff and setting the vote himself on his ouster. Cannon survived that takedown attempt, which was the first time the House had actually voted to consider removing its speaker. A more recent threat against John Boehner in 2015 didn’t make it to a vote but led him to early retirement.

Gaetz was in attendance, but he did not address the room.

Across the way in the Capitol, Democrats lined up for a long discussion and unified around one common point: McCarthy cannot be trusted, several lawmakers in the room said.

“I think it’s safe to say there’s not a lot of good will in that room for Kevin McCarthy,” said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass.

“At the end of the day, the country needs a speaker that can be relied upon,” said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. “We don’t trust him. Their members don’t trust him. And you need a certain degree of trust to be the speaker.”

Removing the speaker launches the House Republicans into chaos heading into a busy fall when Congress will need to fund the government again or risk a mid-November shutdown.

Typically, top leaders would be next in line for the job, but Majority Leader Steve Scalise is battling cancer and Majority Whip Tom Emmer, like any potential candidate, may have trouble securing the vote. Another leading Republican, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, is also a Trump ally.

One of McHenry’s first acts in the temporary position was to oust Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi from her honorary office at the Capitol while she was away in California to pay tribute to Sen. Dianne Feinstein.

“No matter who is going to be the speaker, the challenges still remain,” Scalise said. “But I think the opportunity is there to continue moving forward.”

Asked if he was physically up to the job, Scalise said, “I feel great.”

It took McCarthy himself 15 rounds in January over multiple days of voting before he secured the support from his colleagues to gain the gavel.

Trump, the former president who is the Republican front-runner in the 2024 race to challenge Biden, complained about the chaos. “Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves,” he asked on social media.

Asked about McCarthy’s ouster as he exited court in New York, where he is on trial for business fraud, Trump did not respond.

One key McCarthy ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who is also close with Trump, took to social media urging support for “our speaker.”

Republicans left the chamber in a daze, totally uncertain about next steps. “I honestly don’t know,” said Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. “This is a total disaster.”

Many had lined up to hug McCarthy, some to shake his hand.

Democrats, who have bristled at McCarthy’s leadership — cajoling them one minute, walking away from deals the next — said they were just holding back, waiting for Republicans to figure out how to run the House.

Rep, Don Bacon, R-Neb., the leader of a centrist group, said the only option was to leave the eight hardliners behind and try to work across the aisle. “We’re going to stay with Kevin,” he said. “He told us earlier he’ll never quit.”

But McCarthy made it clear Tuesday night that he would not try to win back the job.

437,2023/10/03, 'speaker of the house',https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/03/politics/mccarthy-gaetz-vote-motion-to-vacate/index.html,"CNN —

Kevin McCarthy will not run for speaker again after the House ousted him from the top leadership post in a historic vote on Tuesday, a move that threatens to plunge House Republicans into even further chaos and turmoil.

The House will now need to elect a new speaker. There is no clear alternative to McCarthy who would have the support needed to win the gavel, but the race for a potential successor is already underway.

The vote to oust McCarthy and his decision not to run for the speakership again marks a major escalation in tensions for a House GOP conference that has been mired in infighting – and it comes just days after McCarthy successfully engineered a last-minute bipartisan effort to avert a government shutdown. No House speaker has ever before been ousted through the passage of a resolution to remove them.

“I don’t regret standing up for choosing governing over grievance. It is my responsibility. It is my job. I do not regret negotiating. Our government is designed to find compromise,” McCarthy said at a wide-ranging press conference Tuesday evening.

Dozens of his staffers were in the room listening with many emotional and hugging each other.

McCarthy told CNN’s Manu Raju he “might” endorse a successor and did not say whether he would remain in Congress. “I’ll look at that,” he said when asked.

McCarthy also unloaded on his critics. Asked by Raju if there’s anything he would have done differently with regard to the eight House Republicans who voted to oust him, McCarthy joked, “Yeah, a lot of them I helped get elected so I probably should have picked someone else.”

A number of House Republicans are said to be considering jumping into the race for speaker. It’s a scramble as House Republicans do not have a plan nor are they unified behind a candidate.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who has been the No. 2 Republican, has started reaching out to members about a potential speakership bid, according to a source familiar.

Immediately following the vote, GOP Rep. Patrick McHenry, a top McCarthy ally, was named interim speaker and the House went into recess as Republicans scrambled to find a path forward. The House is expected to stay out of session for the rest of the week, and Republicans are expected to hold a speaker candidate forum in a week.

The effort to oust the speaker was led by GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz and comes as a bloc of hardline conservatives continued to rebel against McCarthy, voting against key priorities of GOP leadership and repeatedly throwing up roadblocks to the speaker’s agenda.

The vote was 216 to 210 with eight Republicans voting to remove McCarthy from the speakership. The Republicans voting to oust McCarthy as speaker were: Gaetz, Eli Crane and Andy Biggs of Arizona, Ken Buck of Colorado, Tim Burchett of Tennessee, Bob Good of Virginia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Matt Rosendale of Montana.

A number of House Republicans reacted with shock and frustration following the vote.

McCarthy ally and House Rules Chairman Tom Cole said, “Nobody knows what’s going happen next, including all the people that voted to vacate (they) have no earthly idea what, they have no plan. They have no alternative at this point. So it’s just simply a vote for chaos.”

House Democrats signaled ahead of the vote that they would not bail out McCarthy.

There is a significant amount of distrust and anger from House Democrats toward McCarthy, however, over his actions as speaker and the House GOP agenda.

House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries wrote in a letter to his caucus that leadership planned to vote in support of removing McCarthy ahead of the final vote.

“It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War. Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair,” he wrote.

Prior to the final vote, the House failed to table – or block – the effort to oust McCarthy by a vote of 208 to 218 with 11 Republicans voting against the motion to table. The GOP no votes were Gaetz, Crane, Biggs, Buck, Rosendale, Good, Mace, Burchett, Cory Mills of Florida, Victoria Spartz of Indiana and Warren Davidson of Ohio.

McCarthy also told his members he will not cut a deal with Democrats, sources said.

Gaetz was directly pressed by his colleagues during a Tuesday party meeting for his grand plan, and who would replace McCarthy if he was ousted, sources said. Gaetz stood up and responded that there would need to be a new speaker’s election that plays out but didn’t name anyone he had in mind for the job.

The Seahawks head coach is one of the NFL's more colorful bench bosses. Between his youthful exuberance and his signature dad sneakers, there are no shortage of identifiable traits that has made Carroll a memorable coach.

But if you've ever tuned into a Seahawks game, you'll notice something distinctly unique: Carroll's enthusiasm for chomping on gum. Whenever cameras catch Carroll marching down the sideline, his jaw follows him, chewing a mile a minute.

MORE: Why did Geno Smith leave the Giants?

In fact, Carroll's gum-chewing has become known to Seahawks fans around the world, in a gross bit of fandom gone maybe a bit overboard.

Here's what to know about Carroll's choice of concession stand candy:

What gum does Pete Carroll chew?

Step aside, Orbit. Take a hike, Juicy Fruit. Pete Carroll is a Bubble Yum man.

Carroll is a fan of the classic Bubble Yum flavor, and on gamedays, can go through as many as three packs of gum. That means roughly 15 pieces of gum per game and around 260 pieces of gum per season.

ESPN reports that Carroll's gum stash is stocked by the Seahawks director of equipment Erik Kennedy and son Carson. Carson says that the 15 pieces estimate may be more than a bit on the low side, saying that roughly half of a gameday stash — 270 pieces of gum total — will be missing.

The 71-year-old's infatuation with chewing gum has become something of a sticking point with fans. Carroll says it's his ""only habit,"" and that has confused him greatly.

""People ask me all the time about it. It's one of the silliest questions, I don't know why anybody would ever care,"" Carroll said to ESPN's Adam Schefter in December 2022.

MORE: Who are the oldest NFL coaches in 2023?

The obsession for Carroll's gum-chewing habit crosses borders. As ESPN noted, Seahawks fan Tyler Freier got his hands on a piece of game-used Carroll gum and put it in a special resin container — Freier lives in Germany, making the unique piece of memorabilia truly one of a kind.

As far as disposing of the gum, Carroll says he chucks it in the trash, or at least attempts to, but cameras have caught him throwing it in frustration more than once.

So, next time a Seattle receiver makes a miraculous catch, refs shouldn't check him for Stickum. They should check him for Carroll's gum."

He made his Seahawks debut with 3:05 remaining in the first half Monday night.

The quarterback immediately led the Seahawks to a touchdown on a seven-play, 75-yard drive that included a 51-yard completion to tight end Noah Fant. Ken Walker finished off the drive with a 1-yard touchdown run.

The Seahawks, despite losing safety Jamal Adams (concussion), guard Damien Lewis (ankle), guard Phil Haynes (calf) and quarterback Geno Smith (knee), lead the Giants 14-3 at halftime.

The Giants have been outscored 77-9 in the first half this season, the only team without a first half touchdown.

Smith, who is questionable to return, completed 9 of 11 passes for 67 yards and a touchdown. DK Metcalf had the 6-yard touchdown reception, which completed a two-play, 7-yard drive set up by Mario Edwards’ strip-sack and Jordyn Brooks’ recovery of Daniel Jones’ fumble.

Jones is 14-of-17 for 151 yards and has 26 yards rushing on four carries.

Both teams have 155 yards."

Oct 4 (Reuters) - Manchester United are still in the running for a place in the Champions League round of 16 despite Tuesday's 3-2 defeat by Galatasaray leaving them bottom of Group A, manager Erik ten Hag said.

United, who lost 4-3 at Bayern Munich in their opener last month, twice took the lead against the Turkish champions through Rasmus Hojlund but were pegged back by goals from Wilfried Zaha and Kerem Akturkoglu before Mauro Icardi scored the winner.

""Everything is open. There are still four games to go and we have a double (game) with Copenhagen,"" Ten Hag told TNT Sports after United lost for a sixth time in all competitions this season.

""Every game is tough but we know what to do. We know what our demand is there, to stay in this group and to keep our positions open for going through.""

Midfielder Christian Eriksen echoed his manager's sentiments, telling TNT Sports: ""Luckily it is only the start of the competition and we've only played two games.

""There's still a lot of games to play and catch up - we know we need to win every game to have every opportunity to go through.""

United are also struggling on the domestic front and are off to their worst start to a top-flight campaign since 1989-90. Their 1-0 defeat by Crystal Palace on Saturday was their fourth loss in seven Premier League games.

Ten Hag said he hoped to harness United's disappointment ahead of their league game against Brentford on Saturday, when they will look to avoid a third consecutive home defeat in all competitions.

""We have to go again and have energy,"" he said. The setback we have, has to be the fuel for Saturday.""

The nationwide test will include the Wireless Emergency Alert and Emergency Alert System today (Wednesday, Oct. 4) starting at 2:20 p.m. ET (1:20 p.m. CT).

The WEA portion will include messages sent to cell phones. Displayed in either Spanish or English depending on the phone’s main menu settings, the English message will say “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.”

Phones set in Spanish will display “ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA del Sistema Nacional de Alerta de Emergencia. No se necesita acción.”

All cell phones within the range of active towers with a wireless provider that participates in WEA should be capable of receiving the message. Messages for phones used by people with disabilities include a unique tone and vibration.

Alert tones are generally only played with the text is initially received by the phone, FEMA said, and, on most devices, stop as soon as the user clicks a button. If the phone is off before the test alert is sent and not turned back on in the 30 minutes in which the test is being conducted, it will likely not get the text message.

In a non-test situation, WEA alerts are used to send national emergency notifications from the president or FEMA, AMBER alerts about missing children and public safety messages about imminent threats or other safety recommendations.

The EAS portion of the test will be sent to radios and televisions. The EAS test will last one minute and will include broadcasts on radios and televisions, cable systems and satellite radio.

Test messages will be similar to the regular monthly EAS broadcasts and will say: “This is a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, covering the United States from 14:20 to 14:50 hours ET. This is only a test. No action is required by the public.”

In the event of widespread severe weather or other significant event, the tests will be delayed until Oct. 11, FEMA said."

What was expected to be the toughest away game in the group proved to be the case and Barça were made to suffer for most of the night and somehow survived a brutal second half blitz by the home side, but a first half goal from Ferran Torres and a monumental defensive effort were enough to secure all three points and a crucial away result in Europe for a team in desperate need of one.

FIRST HALF

The first 45 minutes went about as expected as Porto began with all the momentum looking to launch an early blitz to get the crowd into the game, and they pressed high to force Barça into mistakes at the back to create opportunities.

The plan worked and the hosts were helped by a Blaugrana side too loose with their passing in dangerous areas, and the back four and goalkeeper Marc-André ter Stegen needed to make some key interventions to stop the home team from scoring the opener.

But the Catalans managed to weather the early storm and started to improve after the first 20 minutes, having more control of the ball and finding their best players in good positions in the final third. João Félix was especially bright and aggressively looked to create for himself and his teammates, and he was the closest of any Barça player to scoring.

A strong 15-minute spell of attacking football didn’t generate a true chance, however, and Barça then lost their best goalscorer as Robert Lewandowski couldn’t continue and had to leave the pitch after taking a tough knock to his ankle early in the half.

Lewandowski was replaced by Ferran Torres, who came on with a ton of hunger and energy and maintained Barça’s good spell with his movement and willingness to take shots on goal, and Ferran was rewarded by his good work just before halftime: a horrible mistake by Porto midfielder Romário Baró created a Barça counter-attack, and Ilkay Gündogan played it through to Torres who showed great composure and calmly placed the ball through Diogo Costa’s legs and into the net for the opening goal.

The halftime whistle came shortly after, and Barça all of a sudden had a valuable lead going into the second half after what was as tough and physical a battle as we expected. Could the visitors finish the job in the final period?

SECOND HALF

Barça were made to suffer to start the second half as Porto amped up their level of intensity and attacking intent and found a lot of spaces with long balls in behind the Blaugrana defense when Barça played a high line. Jules Kounde and Ronald Araujo had to make a couple of sensational athletic plays to stop certain goals by Pepê, and Barça were very lucky not to concede the equalizer in the first 20 minutes of the final period.

Xavi Hernández took a little too long to make substitutions to try and help his team regain control of the game, but he finally acted and sent on Fermín López and Sergi Roberto with 20 minutes to go to add more numbers in midfield and try to have the ball again.

Neither substitute could have a real impact early on and weren’t helped by their teammates who continued to give the ball away in bad areas, and Ter Stegen had to make another big save on a shot by Galeno to keep Porto from finding the net.

The home team kept pushing and were given a penalty after a handball by João Cancelo, but Anthony Taylor reversed his decision after a VAR review showed a handball by a Porto player in the buildup. Barça got out of jail for a second time shortly after when a bicycle kick equalizer by Mehdi Taremi was disallowed for a very narrow offside, and it felt like Porto’s goal was just a matter of time going into the final 10 minutes plus stoppage time.

Porto coach Sergio Conceição made four attacking substitutions in the 85th minute, including former Barça midfielder Nico González, and threw caution to the wind looking for a goal his team had definitely earned. To make things even more difficult for Barça they found themselves down to 10 men after Gavi was shown a red card for a silly second yellow offense, and the Blaugrana were under siege in the dying seconds.

They somehow survived the late pressure, and the final whistle came to give Barça all three points in what was exactly as brutal of a road test as expected. This took an incredible amount of effort and mental toughness, and Barça deserve a lot of credit for excelling at those things and showing they were ready for the fight.

But the truth is they need to play better, and despite the three points they are still not good enough on the road in Europe. The challenge is now to combine their fighting spirit with good football, but they’ve taken a step in the right direction.

Phew.

444,2023/10/04, 'randy gregory',https://www.nfl.com/news/broncos-trading-olb-randy-gregory-to-49ers,"Broncos head coach Sean Payton had told reporters Wednesday that the decision to part ways with Gregory was based on what was best for the team and that the veteran's release would be official within the next two days if a trade partner didn't emerge.

San Francisco was apparently on the phone after hearing opportunity's knock. In acquiring Gregory, the 49ers look to improve on a pass rush that has generated just nine sacks so far in 2023 (ranked 22nd in NFL). Improving those numbers would be a great boost for a defense that's allowed 284.3 yards per game (fifth in NFL) and 14.5 points per game (third). Added pressure elsewhere may also free up Nick Bosa, who has just one sack through four games.

Joining a top-five defense may also benefit Gregory as he looks to rejuvenate his career.

A second-round pick by the Dallas Cowboys in 2015, Gregory has had an up-and-down career with injuries and suspensions aiding his slow start in the NFL. The 15.5 sacks he netted along his final three seasons in Dallas helped Gregory emerge as one of the top free-agent pass rushers of the 2022 offseason, and that's what the Broncos were hoping to get two years ago."

The season finale of Ahsoka season 1 seemed to effectively demand a season 2, given all the cliffhangers (a literal cliffhanger, in Baylan Skoll’s case). However, unlike Andor, pre-planned for two seasons, and The Mandalorian, greenlit for a second season before the first even aired, Ahsoka is…not quite in the same camp.

There has always been a question as to whether this show was planning to lead straight into Dave Filoni’s Mando/Ahsoka crossover movie that’s already been announced, or if more time would be needed for setup. Given how it ended, I think most fans would agree “more time,” meaning a second season.

We do have at least one new update regarding all this, which comes via a Deadline report:

“Some fans have speculated that Dave Filoni’s stand-alone feature film — a culmination of his Disney+/Lucasfilm universe of The Mandalorian, Book of Boba Fett and Ahsoka, etc. — centers around Thrawn, and that is poised to be next. However, we hear that Ahsoka Season 2 is more of a reality in the conversation, though nothing is locked yet. Tonight there were no placards teasing that Ahsoka would return in the immediate future.”

So, it sounds like Disney is leaning toward a second season of Ahsoka rather than putting it all on ice until the Filoni film, which doesn’t have a release date, or even a release window.

Ahsoka Ahsoka

Why was Ahsoka not greenlit for more seasons from the start like its counterparts? My guess is a few reasons:

1) The show has to be insanely expensive. I would guess more so than The Mandalorian and Andor, certainly.

2) It leans extremely heavily on Clone Wars and Rebels viewers who are best positioned to understand all the characters and storylines from the start, and there was a risk that casual viewers would be lost.

3) Disney execs have expressed a desire to start paring down on expensive Disney Plus content. Usually that’s in reference to the recent glut of Marvel shows, culminating in the $212 million, disastrous Secret Invasion, but that could be at play here.

We also just fundamentally don’t official know how Ahsoka viewership was, given that Disney, of course, doesn’t release specific numbers week to week. Disney said the first episode drew 14 million viewers, which is good, but we don’t know how many it hung on to over time. But the fact that there is a conversation leaning toward having a season 2, it may very well have performed good enough for the greenlight.

I would expect news about this to come within the next month or so. Given how clear the other two main Star Wars series were about second seasons (Boba Fett and Obi-Wan always felt like one-offs), Ahsoka is in a unique limbo that hopefully won’t last long.

Sorvino, 56, admitted that she’s faced several challenges since entering the dance competition and aims to overcome a few ""learning curves"" during her time on the show.

""I think it's been a long time since I've thought of myself as, like, sexy,"" Sorvino told Fox News Digital on the ""Dancing with the Stars"" red carpet on Tuesday.

MIRA SORVINO, PAUL SORVINO’S DAUGHTER, MOURNS ‘GOODFELLAS’ STAR: ‘HE WAS THE MOST WONDERFUL FATHER’

""We don’t think of ourselves that way when we enter… the motherhood phase. And maybe that's a mistake… we should always embrace our sexuality, but… I'm not… living in that at the moment.""

The mom-of-four continued to say that has been her biggest ""challenge"" as she attempts to ""re-access that confidence"" so she can ""sell this sexy number.""

Sorvino, daughter of the late ""Goodfellas"" actor Paul Sorvino, added that she hopes her dancing inspires the ""moms of America.""

""All of us moms… we trade that young single person who is kind of confident in her sensuality… to being like the mothering person, the caretaker, the loving person who's there, but not the person who… shines in her own sexy light,"" she said.

MIRA SORVINO SLAMS OSCARS AFTER 'BELOVED FATHER' PAUL SORVINO LEFT OUT OF IN MEMORIAM TELECAST

The ""Romy and Michelle’s High School Reunion"" star performed a sexy salsa to the song ""Bailando"" by Enrique Iglesias with her ""Dancing with the Stars"" partner Gleb Savchenko.

The pair earned a total score of 18 from the judges, which qualified the couple to move on to the next round. Actress Jamie Lynn Spears was sent home Tuesday night.

""Dancing with the Stars"" kicked off season 32 on Sept. 26. Former ""Fresh Prince of Bel-Air"" star Alfonso Ribeiro is the host this season, while former professional dancer and judge Julianne Hough joins as co-host.

Meanwhile, Sorvino’s father died of natural causes in July 2022. The actor, who famously played Paulie Cicero in ""Goodfellas,"" passed away in Jacksonville, Florida. The 83-year-old had dealt with health issues over the past few years.

""My father the great Paul Sorvino has passed,"" the actress tweeted at the time. ""My heart is rent asunder – a life of love and joy and wisdom with him is over. He was the most wonderful father. I love him so much. I’m sending you love in the stars Dad as you ascend.""

448,2023/10/04, 'fema',https://www.fema.gov/press-release/20231003/fema-and-fcc-plan-nationwide-emergency-alert-test-oct-4-test-messages-will,"WASHINGTON -- FEMA, in coordination with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), will conduct a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System (EAS) and Wireless Emergency Alerts (WEA) tomorrow, Oct. 4.

The national test will consist of two portions, testing WEA and EAS capabilities. Both tests are scheduled to begin at approximately 2:20 p.m. ET on Wednesday, Oct. 4.

The WEA portion of the test will be directed to consumer cell phones. This will be the third nationwide test, but the second test to all WEA-compatible cellular devices. The test message will display in either English or in Spanish, depending on the language settings of the wireless handset.

The EAS portion of the test will be sent to radios and televisions. This will be the seventh nationwide EAS test.

FEMA and the FCC are coordinating with EAS participants, wireless providers, emergency managers and other stakeholders in preparation for this national test to minimize confusion and maximize the public safety value of the test.

The purpose of the test is to ensure that the systems continue to be effective means of warning the public about emergencies, particularly those on the national level. In case the Oct. 4 test is postponed, due to widespread severe weather or other significant events, the back-up testing date is Oct. 11.

The WEA portion of the test will be initiated using FEMA’s Integrated Public Alert and Warning System (IPAWS), a centralized internet-based system administered by FEMA that enables authorities to send authenticated emergency messages to the public through multiple communications networks. The WEA test will be administered via a code sent to cell phones.

This year the EAS message will be disseminated as a Common Alerting Protocol (CAP) message via the Integrated Public Alert and Warning System-Open Platform for Emergency Networks (IPAWS-OPEN).

All wireless phones should receive the message only once. The following can be expected from the nationwide WEA test:

Beginning at approximately 2:20 p.m. ET, cell towers will broadcast the test for approximately 30 minutes. During this time, WEA-compatible wireless phones that are switched on, within range of an active cell tower, and in a geographic area where the wireless provider participates in WEA, should be capable of receiving the test message.

For consumers, the message that appears on their phones will read: “THIS IS A TEST of the National Wireless Emergency Alert System. No action is needed.”

Phones with the main menu set to Spanish will display: “ESTA ES UNA PRUEBA del Sistema Nacional de Alerta de Emergencia. No se necesita acción.”

Similar to when your phone receives an Amber Alert, the WEA alert tone is generally only played when the alert is initially received by the phone and on some devices stops as soon as the user clicks a button.

If a phone is off before the test alert is sent and not turned back on until after the WEA Test expires (approximately 30 minutes), the phone should not get the test message.

WEA alerts are created and sent by authorized federal, state, local, tribal and territorial government agencies through IPAWS to participating wireless providers, which deliver the alerts to compatible handsets in geo-targeted areas. To help ensure that these alerts are accessible to the entire public, including people with disabilities, the alerts are accompanied by a unique tone and vibration.

Important information about the EAS test:

The EAS portion of the test is scheduled to last approximately one minute and will be conducted with the participation of radio and television broadcasters, cable systems, satellite radio and television providers and wireline video providers.

The test message will be similar to the regular monthly EAS test messages with which the public is familiar. It will state: “This is a nationwide test of the Emergency Alert System, issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, covering the United States from 14:20 to 14:50 hours ET. This is only a test. No action is required by the public.""

Note to Broadcast Outlets:

Please do not include the tones or Attention Signals in broadcast TV or radio coverage about the Nationwide Emergency Alert Test being conducted on Oct. 4, 2023. Doing so could result in a violation of federal regulations, which prohibit the use of Emergency Alert System codes (which are audible tones) or the EAS and WEA Attention Signals, or simulations of them, except in actual emergencies, authorized tests of the EAS, or authorized Public Service Announcements (PSAs)."
449,2023/10/05,'dick butkus',https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/05/sport/dick-butkus-death-illinois-bears/index.html,"CNN —

Dick Butkus, the hard-hitting Pro Football Hall of Fame linebacker who starred for his hometown Chicago Bears before his outgoing personality earned him popularity in television and film acting, has died at the age of 80, the team announced Thursday.

Butkus died “peacefully in his sleep overnight at home in Malibu,” California, a statement from his family, posted by the Bears on social media, reads.

“The Butkus family is gathering with Dick’s wife, Helen. They appreciate your prayers and support,” the family’s statement reads.

Butkus was “the ultimate Bear, and one of the greatest players in NFL history,” Chicago Bears chairman George H. McCaskey said.

“He was Chicago’s son,” McCaskey said. “His contributions to the game he loved will live forever and we are grateful he was able to be at our home opener this year to be celebrated one last time by his many fans.”

News of Butkus’ death spread more than an hour before the Bears started a Thursday night game against the Washington Commanders. The teams and fans observed a moment of silence before the game at FedEx Field in Landover, Maryland.

A ferocious tackler drafted out of the University of Illinois, Butkus was an imposing force as the Bears’ middle linebacker for his nine NFL seasons in the 1960s and 1970s, and made eight Pro Bowls.

Video Ad Feedback Nichols says this is why Butkus represented so much to Chicago 01:22 - Source: CNN

Butkus thought his intensity on the field was simply how the game should be played, according to an article on the Bears’ website.

“I thought that was the way that everybody should have played, but I guess they didn’t because they were claiming that I had a special way of playing,” he said when asked about his ferocity, according to the article.

He retired at age 31 after playing part of the 1973 season, a few years after suffering a serious knee injury, and was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1979, his first year eligible. Butkus was enshrined in the College Football Hall of Fame in 1983.

In 1985, the Butkus Award was founded and given to the top linebacker at the professional, collegiate and high school levels.

The Bears retired Butkus’ No. 51 jersey in 1994. Butkus was named to the NFL’s All-Decade Teams – selected by a Hall of Fame committee – for both decades he played, and was voted to the NFL’s 75th and 100th Anniversary All-Time Teams.

Butkus ended his career with 1,020 tackles and 22 interceptions, ESPN reported.

Butkus ventured into acting and announcing after his retirement from the Bears, appearing in dozens of television shows and movies – many alongside former NFL defensive player Bubba Smith, according to the Bears’ website.

The former athlete had roles on shows including “MacGyver,” “Hang Time,” “Half Nelson,” “Blue Thunder” and “My Two Dads.” Butkus starred with Smith in a series of Miller Lite ads and he appeared on the silver screen in films such as “Any Given Sunday,” “The Longest Yard” and “Necessary Roughness.”

Butkus also served as the Bears’ radio announcer for several years and was a panelist on “The NFL Today” pregame show on CBS.

‘I was fierce’

Richard Marvin “Dick” Butkus, a Chicago native, was born December 9, 1942, in the city’s south-side Fernwood neighborhood, according to a biography on his website.

Butkus was the youngest of nine children and came from a blue-collar family of Lithuanian descent.

He began envisioning his future as a professional football player by the fifth grade, the biography reads.

“I worked hard at becoming one, just like society says you should,” Butkus said, according to his website. “It said you had to be fierce. I was fierce. Tough.”

The athlete showcased his football skills at Chicago Vocational High School and the University of Illinois before being selected with the third pick in the 1965 NFL Draft, according to the Bears’ website.

NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell remembered Butkus as “a fierce and passionate competitor” on Thursday.

“Dick’s intuition, toughness and athleticism made him the model linebacker whose name will forever be linked to the position and the Chicago Bears,” Goodell said."

But one particular interview with Victoria caused David to step in and set the facts straight.

In the series’ first episode, Victoria explains what initially drew her to David, saying: “I think also we both come from families that work really hard. Both of our parents work very hard, we’re very working class.”

David then pops his head in the door from the other room and sternly tells Victoria: “Be honest!”

“I am being honest,” she replies. But David counters, “What car did your dad drive you to school in?”

Though Victoria says “it’s not a simple answer” and “it depends,” David insists and she eventually relents, admitting: “OK, in the ’80s my dad had a Rolls Royce.”

David and Victoria met at a football match in 1997 and soon became a hot topic in the U.K. press, which dubbed them Posh and Becks. The couple married in 1999 and share four children: Brooklyn, Romeo, Cruz and Harper.

In an interview with Variety, “Beckham” director Fisher Stevens said that he spent over 30 hours interviewing David Beckham for the docuseries, and 14 hours with Victoria. All that time with the couple led to some funny on-screen banter between the two, which was of course caught on-camera.

“It hasn’t all been rosy with his relationship with Victoria. There’s constant controversy,” Stevens said. “Frankly, I was quite moved by their relationship at the end of the day, and — after all they’ve been through — how much they love each other, and how close they are.”

“Beckham” is now streaming on Netflix."

Union Saint-Gilloise at Anfield on Octo

Ryan Gravenberch has put his impressive start to life at Liverpool down to having the trust of his manager and being given minutes on the pitch.

The Netherlands international was tipped for big things when joining Bayern Munich from Ajax in 2022, but struggled for playing time in Bavaria.

Liverpool swooped to sign him in the summer transfer window, and he has been given regular chances by manager Jurgen Klopp.

The German tactician has been rewarded with impressive displays, and Gravenberch grabbed his first goal in a Liverpool shirt when pouncing on a goalkeeping error to fireThe Reds in front against Union Saint-Gilloise in the UEFA Europa League

“It is great, it feels super-good,” Gravenberch said on TNT Sports following the 2-0 win. “It is the easiest goal of my career. It does not matter, a goal is a goal.“

Asked for his opinion on why things have changed for him in recent months, Gravenberch said: “It is the minutes.

“As a player when you get minutes you get confident and that is it.”

'When you give a player minutes, you get confident' - Gravenberch on settling into Liverpool

Michael Owen was impressed with Gravenberch’s performance against the Belgian side, and feels he could have a big season for Liverpool.

“He was very good tonight,” Owen said in the TNT Sports studio. “What a night for him, his first goal at Anfield.

“I think he could be a good player for Liverpool.

“Liverpool’s midfield was torn up over the summer and there is an opportunity for whoever wants to grab it, and he grabbed his opportunity tonight.”

Liverpool are unbeaten after two games in Group E, and face Toulouse on October 26.

There have been some pleasant surprises, like the Los Angeles Rams, Houston Texans, and...Tampa Bay Buccaneers? On the other side of the coin, we’ve had our fair share of disappointments—the Bengals, Giants, and Vikings are all 1-3 after playoff appearances in 2022.

Week 5 is when teams start to separate themselves. It’s a crossroads for many, including our Atlanta Falcons—will the offense bounce back after a two-game skid, or will the team continue sliding out of the NFC playoff picture? Things kick off with Thursday Night Football, featuring a solid Washington Commanders (2-2) team taking on the struggling Chicago Bears (0-4).

Let’s get right to tonight’s pick, which I’ll be making on a straight moneyline (aka picking the winner) basis. I’ll still provide the information on the spread and over/under, for those interested. At the bottom, I’ll show the rest of the staff’s picks for the game.

All odds are taken from DraftKings Sportsbook and are subject to change. See the current odds here.

Thursday Night Football: Chicago Bears (0-4) at Washington Commanders (2-2)

The pick: Commanders (-265)

Spread: Commanders -6 | Over/Under: 45 | Moneyline: Commanders -265, Bears +215

I honestly feel for Bears fans at this point. Chicago looked like they might have been putting it together a bit, up 28-7 over the Denver Broncos in the third quarter. They proceeded to blow that 21-point lead and lose, 31-28. This is a team in utter disarray, and now they’ve got to play the Commanders. Washington is 2-2 after a 2-0 start, but this is a solid team that will be a tough out every week thanks to that defense. Said defense will make things difficult for the Bears, and Chicago’s defense is incapable of slowing any offense down.

Wednesday's drawing will now be the second-largest jackpot in Powerball history, adding to the excitement.

To reach this size, the jackpot has been growing since July 22 when it started as a $20 million prize. There have been 35 consecutive drawings without a winner.

The winning numbers were drawn just after 11 p.m. ET and we have the results below.

If someone had won Monday's drawing, they would have had the cash option of $679.8 million.

Here's a look at the winning numbers for Monday, Oct. 9.

Powerball winning numbers: 10/9/23

The winning numbers for Saturday night's drawing were 67, 34, 46, 55, 16, and the Powerball was 14. The Power Play was 3X.

Winning lottery numbers are sponsored by Jackpocket, the official digital lottery courier of the USA TODAY network.

Did anyone win the Powerball last night?

No, there were no jackpot winners in Monday's drawing.

Before the next Powerball drawing, it's important to be aware of the following information.

What are the odds of winning the Powerball?

It's understandable that some lottery players are enticed by the whopping $1.04 billion jackpot, but it's essential to keep in mind that the chances of winning Powerball's top prize are exceedingly slim.

The odds of winning a Powerball jackpot are about 1 in 292.2 million.

The overall odds of winning a Powerball prize (across all tiers) are about 1 in 24.9.

To participate in the Powerball game, players can purchase a ticket for $2 per play. The game requires players to choose five numbers from one to 69 for the white balls, and one number from one to 26 for the red Powerball. Alternatively, players can opt to receive random numbers.

In order to win the jackpot, it is necessary to match the numbers for all of the five white balls and the red Powerball.

In addition to the grand prize, Powerball offers eight other ways to win based on the number of matched balls in the non-jackpot tiers.

The non-jackpot prizes offered range from $4 to $1 million. By paying an additional $1, you can choose to participate in ""Powerplay"" that increases non-jackpot winnings by 2, 3, 4, 5, or 10 times.

According to Powerball, the 10X Powerplay option is exclusively applicable to jackpots worth $150 million or less. Additionally, the game's ""Match 5"" prize for the second-tier is limited to a maximum of $2 million if the Powerplay feature is utilized.

An additional add-on feature called ""Double Play,"" which gives players another chance to match their numbers after each Powerball drawing, is available in some jurisdictions for $1 per play.

Where can you buy lottery tickets?

Tickets can be purchased in-person at gas stations, convenience stores and grocery stores. Some airport terminals may also sell lottery tickets.

You can also order tickets online through Jackpocket, the official digital lottery courier of the USA TODAY Network, in these U.S. states: Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Idaho, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Oregon, Texas, Washington D.C. and West Virginia.

The celebrity tattoo artist and “LA Ink” star shared a video of her recent baptism in an Instagram video Tuesday. In the clip, set to angelic choral music, Von D can be seen enjoying the baptism church service before being dunked into a baptismal pool by the pastor performing the ceremony.

""Katherine von Drachenberg, upon your profession of faith in the Lord Jesus Christ and in obedience to his divine command, I baptize you, my sister, in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,"" the pastor said.

The religious rite comes after Von D revealed in a July 2022 Instagram post that she was distancing herself from her consumption of the occult arts. The tattoo artist shared a photo of the various items she was parting ways with, including texts on witchcraft and boxes of tarot cards.

“I’ve always found beauty in the macabre, but at this point, I just had to ask myself what is my relationship with this content?” Von D wrote at the time. “And the truth is, I just don’t want to invite any of these things into our family’s lives, even if it comes disguised in beautiful covers, collecting dust on my shelves.”

Von D added that the revelation wasn’t meant to “put anyone down if you’re into this stuff,” as she was reflecting on the evolution of her own spiritual life.

“I love everyone regardless of where they might be at,” Von D wrote. “But right now, it’s never been more clear to me that there is a spiritual battle taking place, and I want to surround myself and my family with love and light.

""We are in a war,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared in a video on social media. He ordered strikes on Gaza and called for an ""extensive reserve mobilization"" as the nation responds to the unprecedented incursion.

Over 200 Israelis have been killed and more than 1,200 were injured, a spokesperson for Israel Defense Forces said. The Palestinian Ministry of Health in Gaza said Sunday that 313 people were killed, including 20 children, and about 1,990 were injured.

Hamas fighters captured a number of civilians and soldiers as hostages, with fighting ongoing in southern Israel many hours after the operation began, the Israeli military said.

President Joe Biden condemned what he called an “appalling assault against Israel by Hamas terrorists” and said that “Israel has a right to defend itself and its people.” He added, “My Administration’s support for Israel’s security is rock solid and unwavering.”

As battles raged on the streets of southern Israel, the country launched retaliation strikes that leveled buildings in Gaza. An exchange of fire at Israel’s border with Lebanon and a deadly shooting of Israeli tourists in Egypt on Sunday also fueled fears of broader violence.

Israel’s Security Cabinet officially approved a “war situation,” the prime minister’s office said Sunday on X, formerly known as Twitter. It came after Netanyahu warned of a “long and difficult” conflict as he concluded a meeting of Israel’s Security Cabinet late Saturday.

At least 250 people were killed in Israel, according to the country’s Foreign Affairs Ministry, while the Palestinian Health Ministry said at least 370 people were killed in Gaza and hundreds more were injured.

Social media was also replete with videos of Hamas fighters taking civilians and soldiers hostage. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Sunday that the U.S. was “actively working” to verify reports that several Americans may be among the dead, as well as reports that there could be some U.S. hostages."

Buffalo held the ball on offense for less than 22 minutes of game time. It ranked in the top 3 in the league in time of possession coming into the day at over 34 minutes per game.

The Bills did manage to score a pair of touchdowns late in the game during a frenetic comeback attempt, but by then Buffalo's depleted defense ran out of steam and allowed a pair of TD runs by Jags RB Travis Etienne.Â

""Just a little bit of tempo and just what we were seeing on film and getting to good plays,"" Allen said. ""We just came out late in the third quarter, early fourth and felt like we had some more urgency and we didn't have that early on in the game. So we gotta be better with that.""

Jordan Davis: A big jump Year 1 to Year 2Â

""I definitely have more confidence now than I did 12 months ago. Just being here for a full season, you know what to expect and how to prepare and what it takes to go out there and have success,"" Jordan Davis said. ""You know that you're here for a reason, and being the first-round pick last year, I felt that, but now I'm seeing it every day.""Â

Davis started five games of the 13 he played as a rookie, battled an ankle injury, and showed a tremendous upside. In four games this year, Davis has 17 total tackles, 1.5 quarterback sacks, 3 quarterback pressures, 6 quarterback hurries, and a forced fumble.Â Â

Quite a jump.Â"
462,2023/10/08, 'chiefs vs vikings',https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401547462,"MINNEAPOLIS -- — Though Patrick Mahomes and the defending Super Bowl champion Kansas City Chiefs have had plenty of scares already, they've lost just one game, by one point.

The frightening part for the rest of the NFL is what they might look like once they hit their stride.

Mahomes threw two touchdown passes in the third quarter, one to Travis Kelce after the All-Pro tight end had left the game with an ankle injury, and the Chiefs beat the Minnesota Vikings 27-20 on Sunday.

Mahomes went 31 for 41 for 281 yards and no turnovers in his most efficient performance of the season for the Chiefs (4-1), who once again won while not at their best.

“There's a lot of young guys out there, and we're going to keep everybody moving and going in the right direction,” said Mahomes, who completed passes to 10 receivers. “I think by the end of the year we're going to be dangerous, because you're not going to know who's going to get those opportunities throughout the game.”

Kirk Cousins threw for scores to Jordan Addison and Alexander Mattison for the Vikings (1-4). They had two chances at the tying touchdown in the final five minutes, but a late hamstring injury to star wide receiver Justin Jefferson and a lack of timeouts from earlier mismanagement of the game were ultimately too much to overcome.

Jefferson slipped on the turf while trying to make a cut on his route during a third-down pass deep in Kansas City territory. He grabbed the back of his right leg and limped slowly to the sideline. Coach Kevin O'Connell said after the game it was too early to provide a timeline for Jefferson's return.

Mahomes hit Justin Watson with a 33-yard heave on third-and-18 from his own 17 to extend the Chiefs' first possession of the second half. The two-time MVP finished that drive with a tiebreaking 8-yard scoring toss to Rashee Rice.

“We were backed up,"" Mahomes said. “That really could've changed the game.”

Kelce, whose rumored girlfriend Taylor Swift was not in attendance after the superstar singer attended the Chiefs' previous two games, fell awkwardly to the turf after catching a pass in the second quarter and went for X-rays. He watched the first possession after halftime from the sideline and went back in for the next one.

With coordinator Steve Spagnuolo sending plenty of extra rushers at Cousins, the defense was the catalyst for the Chiefs. Jefferson was held to three catches and 28 yards, both season lows, with cornerback L'Jarius Sneed leading the effort from the secondary.

“They played exceptionally today,” said Chris Jones, who had one of the three sacks and three of the 12 hits on Cousins. “Hats off go to those guys.”

All four of Minnesota's losses have come by eight points or fewer this year after a record 11 wins in 11 one-score games in 2022. The Vikings lost a fumble on their opening possession, again, a turnover by tight end Josh Oliver that the Chiefs recovered at the Minnesota 45. Isaiah Pacheco's touchdown run capped the drive and gave Kansas City the early lead.

The Vikings have an NFL-most 12 turnovers, including eight lost fumbles.

“We need to protect the football, and we need to make plays when they are there,” said Cousins, who went 29 for 47 for 284 yards and no turnovers.

STOPPED SHORT

After Cousins connected with Mattison on a 9-yard touchdown pass that pulled the Vikings within seven points with 12:11 left, the defense did its part by forcing punts on both of the Chiefs' possessions.

The Vikings had fourth-and-7 at the 19 with 4:54 remaining and took a delay of game penalty. Then Cousins chucked the ball into the end zone near Addison as he was hit on a cornerback blitz by Trent McDuffie. Addison collided with Sneed, but the flag for defensive pass interference was waved off.

“I feel like I had my head back,” said Sneed, whose removal of his helmet to argue the initial call did not get penalized, much to the anger of O'Connell.

The Vikings regained possession with 1:07 to go at their 19, but Cousins was again under heavy pressure. On the final play from the Chiefs 38, he was sacked by Mike Danna.

“We’ve got to find a way to eliminate some of those outcomes from affecting our chances of winning the game,” O'Connell said.

CHECK THAT BOX

The victory gave Mahomes at least one against every opponent in the league. The Vikings were the only team he'd never beaten in six years as Kansas City's starter. This was the first time he'd ever faced the team that plays in the city where his father, Pat Mahomes, pitched for the Minnesota Twins.

INJURY REPORT

Chiefs: LB Nick Bolton (ankle) was sidelined for the third straight game, replaced by Drue Tranquill.

Vikings: C Garrett Bradbury (back) returned to the starting lineup after missing the last three games.

UP NEXT

Chiefs: Host Denver on Thursday night.

Vikings: Visit Chicago next Sunday.

463,2023/10/09,'seattle earthquake',https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/6-3-magnitude-earthquake-shakes-part-of-western-afghanistan-where-earlier-quake-killed-over-2000/,"CHAHAK, Afghanistan (AP) — Another strong earthquake shook western Afghanistan on Wednesday morning after an earlier one killed more than 2,000 people and flattened whole villages in Herat province in what was one of the most destructive quakes in the country’s recent history.

The magnitude 6.3 earthquake on Wednesday was about 28 kilometers (17 miles) outside Herat, the provincial capital, and 10 kilometers (6 miles) deep, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It triggered a landslide that blocked the main Herat-Torghondi highway, Information Ministry spokesman Abdul Wahid Rayan said.

Janan Sayiq, a spokesman for the Afghan Taliban government’s national disaster authority said Wednesday’s earthquake killed at least one person and injured around 120 others.

The aid group Doctors Without Borders said Herat Regional Hospital received 117 who got injured in Wednesday’s temblor. The group, also known by its French acronym MSF, said it sent additional medical supplies to the hospital and was setting up four more medical tents at the facility.

“Our teams are assisting in triaging emergency cases and managing stabilized patients admitted in the medical tents,” MSF said on X, formerly known as Twitter.

Wednesday’s quake also flattened all 700 homes in Chahak village, which was untouched by the tremors of previous days. Now there are mounds of soil where dwellings used to be. But no deaths have been reported so far in Chahak because people have taken shelter in tents this week, fearing for their lives as tremors continue to rock Herat.

Villagers are distraught over the loss of their homes and livestock, often their only possessions, and worry about the coming harsh winter months. Some said they had never seen an earthquake before and wondered when the shaking of the ground would stop.

Many said they have no peace of mind inside the tents for fear the “ground will open and swallow us at any moment.”

The epicenter of Saturday’s quake — also of the same magnitude 6.3 — was about 40 kilometers (25 miles) northwest of the provincial capital, and several aftershocks have been strong.

Taliban officials said more than 2,000 had died across Herat after the earlier quakes. They subsequently said the quakes killed and injured thousands but didn’t give a breakdown of casualties.

Besides rubble and funerals after Saturday’s devastation, there is little left of the villages in the region’s dusty hills. Survivors are struggling to come to terms with the loss of multiple family members and in many places, living residents are outnumbered by volunteers who had come to search the debris and dig mass graves.

In Naib Rafi, a village that previously had about 2,500 residents, people said almost no one was still alive besides men who were working outside when the quake struck. Survivors worked all day with excavators to dig long trenches for mass burials.

On a barren field in the district of Zinda Jan, a bulldozer removed mounds of earth to clear space for a long row of graves.

“It is very difficult to find a family member from a destroyed house and a few minutes to later bury him or her in a nearby grave, again under the ground,” said Mir Agha, from the city of Herat, who had joined hundreds of volunteers to help the locals.

Nearly 2,000 houses in 20 villages were destroyed, the Taliban have said. The area hit by the quakes has just one government-run hospital.

On Tuesday, U.N. deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said Zinda Jan was the worst-affected area, with more than 1,300 people killed and nearly 500 people still reported missing.

He said U.N. satellite imagery also indicated extreme levels of destruction in the district of Injil.

“Our humanitarian colleagues warn that children are particularly vulnerable and have suffered severe psychological distress from the earthquake,” he said.

Earthquakes are common in Afghanistan, where there are a number of fault lines and frequent movement among three nearby tectonic plates. Afghans are still reeling from recent quakes, including the magnitude 6.5 earthquake in March that struck much of western Pakistan and eastern Afghanistan, and an earthquake that hit eastern Afghanistan in June 2022, flattening stone and mud-brick homes and killing at least 1,000 people.

Zabihullah Mujahid, the main spokesman for the Taliban government, listed the countries that have so far aided the people affected by the quake in Herat, in a statement posted on X.

He said Iran sent 15 vehicles loaded with aid alongside support and technical teams, while Turkey sent medical teams food, non-food items and medicine. The United Arab Emirates and Turkmenistan also helped with food, medicine, and clothes.

He added a technical team of 49 members from Kazakhstan is assisting those affected by the quake.

In his post, Mujahid said Saudi Arabia provided financial assistance to the people of Herat while China donated $200,000 in cash aid through the Afghan Foreign Affairs ministry.

Neighboring Pakistan is among the countries that have offered assistance but the delivery of its humanitarian aid has been on hold since Monday.

Sponsored

On Wednesday morning, the pledged supplies had yet to leave Pakistan. Authorities were waiting for “clearance” from the Taliban, two government officials in Islamabad said, speaking on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media.

Ties between the two countries have come under pressure since Pakistan announced a deadline for undocumented migrants, including 1.7 million Afghans living illegally in the country, to leave before Oct. 31 to avoid arrests and forced deportation.

464,2023/10/09, 'kelce ex girlfriend',https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/taylor-swifts-romance-travis-kelce-stirs-drama-ex-girlfriend-inner-circle,"Taylor Swift's new alleged romance with Travis Kelce has sparked turbulence in both the entertainment and sports industries.

While a source tells Fox News Digital that the relationship between the pop star and Kansas City Chief's player is still ""very new,"" it has certainly transfixed the public and caused a media circus.

The attention the relationship has garnered has not gone unnoticed, particularly by two ex-girlfriends of Kelce's, both of whom have made it clear they are not interested in the ""Taylor + Travis"" tour.

TAYLOR SWIFT BLASTS TRAVIS KELCE INTO HOLLYWOOD STARDOM; ROMANCE A GAMBLE FOR NFL STAR

Here is a look at what the two women have said, through words and actions.

Maya Benberry

Hell hath no fury like a woman left scorned. Maya Benberry met Kelce on his 2016 E! dating show, ""Catching Kelce,"" where 50 women, one from each state, competed for the tight end's heart. She won the competition and said she was in love with him and that they dated for eight months. She even thought she would marry the NFL star.

Benberry said that infidelity, which she learned through social media, led to their split.

""Like the saying goes, ‘once a cheater always a cheater,’"" the life coach, 31, boldly claimed of Kelce. ""Certain qualities don't change in men. I feel like Travis is a narcissist, so most narcissists don't change,"" she told ""Inside Edition.""

A source close to Kelce told Fox News Digital that ""he never cheated on her"" and that Benberry is ""trying to get her 15 minutes of fame.""

Benberry said she is ""offended"" by that narrative, and that she originally spoke out about the cheating five years ago.

""I don't feel anyway about [Taylor] dating Travis. It's cute. I mean, I had him first,"" she pointed out to ""Inside Edition"". ""It's nothing about Taylor. It's more about [Travis] led me to believe that we have a future. And now, five years later, you're laughing. And I feel like you're mocking me. I'm not jealous or bitter about Taylor. She's beautiful. She's successful. We're in two different lanes. My issue is more with Travis in the sense of now you're trying to turn me into - I don't know. A bitter person? A liar? Like I'm delusional? And I'm the furthest thing from that.""

I'm not jealous or bitter about Taylor. She's beautiful. She's successful. We're in two different lanes. My issue is more with Travis. — Maya Benberry on her ex-boyfriend Travis Kelce's romance with Taylor Swift

Despite praising Swift, Benberry says she questions the ""genuineness"" of the duo's relationship, since Kelce has been ""talking to the media a lot.""

A representative for Benberry did not immediately respond to Fox News DIgital's request for comment.

This past summer, Kelce hinted on his own podcast ""New Heights"" that he might be into Swift, while also explaining what happened (or didn't) when attending her Eras Tour.

""I was a little butt-hurt I didn't get to hand her one of the bracelets I made for her. . . . If you're up on Taylor Swift concerts, there are friendship bracelets,"" Kelce explained of an exchange that has become common between fans during Swift's Eras Tour. ""And I received a bunch of them being there, but I wanted to give Taylor Swift one with my number on it,"" implying that it was his phone number, not his jersey number.

A few months later, reports emerged that the pop-star and eight-time Pro Bowler were hanging out. Then came Swift's outings to Arrowhead Stadium in Missouri to watch Kelce play. Her presence solidified the romance rumors, and she was seated in a suite with Kelce's mother, Donna.

Kelce then shared on his podcast that he was thrilled Swift accepted his invitation to come to one of his games. ""Shoutout to Taylor for pulling up. That was pretty ballsy,"" he told his co-host, brother Jason. ""I just thought it was awesome how everybody in the suite had nothing but great things to say about her, you know, the friends and family. She looked amazing. Everybody was talking about her in great light. And on top of that, you know, the day went perfect – for Chiefs fans, of course.""

After Swift's second appearance at his game at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey, where she was featured over a dozen times on screen, Kelce admitted that the NFL was ""overdoing it.""

Up until last year, Kelce was dating journalist Kayla Nicole, with whom he had an off-and-on relationship. The couple first split in 2020, and Kelce defended himself from brewing cheating rumors at the time. The couple reunited a few months later, only to split again in May 2022.

Nicole quickly infiltrated the Chief's Kingdom, becoming fast friends with the quarterback Patrick Mahomes and his girlfriend, now wife, Brittany.

The two women frequently posted content together at Chief's games. Nicole was also in attendance for many of Brittany's biggest events - including her baby shower and bachelorette party.

However, some bad blood seems to have infiltrated the former foursome, with Nicole now unfollowing Brittany on Instagram. Fans noticed Nicole unfollowed Mrs. Mahomes after Brittany was spotted out to dinner with Swift in New York last weekend, and again in a suite at MetLife Stadium watching the Chiefs beat the New York Jets.

465,2023/10/09, 'brock purdy',https://www.cbsnews.com/sanfrancisco/news/brock-purdy-pitches-4-touchdowns-leads-49ers-over-cowboys/,"SANTA CLARA -- Brock Purdy and the San Francisco 49ers quickly turned the biggest challenge of their young season into a laugher.

Purdy threw three of his four touchdown passes to George Kittle, San Francisco's defense hounded Dak Prescott all night and the 49ers extended their dominance over the Dallas Cowboys with a 42-10 victory Sunday.

""It felt good, especially going against the No. 1 defense in the league,"" star left tackle Trent Williams said. ""Obviously, that's a big test for Week 5 of the year. I think we pass that test with flying colors. But we're going to get tested again.""

The Niners (5-0) knocked the Cowboys out of the playoffs in tight games the past two seasons, adding intrigue to this early season matchup between perceived contenders.

The rematch wasn't even close.

The Niners led 14-0 before the Cowboys got their initial first down of the night and were never really threatened on the way to matching a franchise record with their 15th straight regular-season win and earning their fifth 5-0 start.

""I knew it was our biggest game so far this year as far as nationally and just media wise and the hype,"" coach Kyle Shanahan said. ""Sometimes you worry your team can get too up for stuff. ... They were so locked in all week. They didn't make too big a deal of this game and were ready to go.""

Purdy calmly picked apart the league's stingiest defense to improve to 10-0 as a starter in the NFL and San Francisco's defense made life difficult on Prescott all night.

Prescott was sacked three times and heaved an interception into double coverage after Dallas fell behind 28-10 in the third quarter. He threw two more interceptions in the fourth quarter with his only highlight coming on a 26-yard TD pass to KaVontae Turpin in the second quarter.

""We see the talent in the room and what our potential is, but it's about doing it week in and week out,"" said linebacker Fred Warner, who had a sack, an interception and a forced fumble. ""To do it this game on this stage against a really good football team, it really meant a lot.""

It was Dallas' most lopsided defeat since losing 49-17 to New Orleans in 2013.

""Didn't see it coming,"" Prescott said. ""Put everything into this, and got punched in the mouth. It was humbling a couple weeks ago against Arizona. But this may be the most humbling game I've ever been a part of.""

Purdy again was nearly mistake free. A week after throwing only one incomplete pass in a win over Arizona, he repeatedly found openings downfield to Brandon Aiyuk, Deebo Samuel and especially Kittle.

Purdy finished 17 for 24 for 252 yards and has not thrown an interception all season. He connected on a 19-yard TD pass to Kittle on the opening drive, a 38-yarder early in the second quarter on a reverse flea-flicker and then a 10-yarder to put the game away in the third quarter.

""The defense does their job, so it makes life easy for me,"" Purdy said.

Kittle became the first Niners player with three TD catches in a game since Vernon Davis in 2009.

Purdy added a 1-yard TD pass to Kyle Juszczyk in the fourth quarter and the rest of the game was merely garbage time with mostly backups.

""You have to learn how to take a punch,"" Cowboys edge rusher Micah Parsons said. ""We got punched in the face tonight and that's just the reality of it. I'm not shying from it. We got beat up in all phases. And that's the reality.""

FAST STARTERS

The Niners took the opening kick and drove 75 yards in seven plays to score on a 19-yard pass from Purdy to Kittle to take the lead. San Francisco has four TDs and one field goal on the opening drive this season for a league-leading 31 points.

The 49ers were just as tough on defense early, holding Dallas to 6 yards in the first quarter and no first downs for more than 17 minutes.

SCORING STREAK

Christian McCaffrey scored on a 1-yard run in the second quarter after losing a fumble near the goal line earlier in the game. It was the 14th straight game he has scored a TD in the regular season or playoffs. The only players in NFL history with longer streaks are Lenny Moore (17 games), O.J. Simpson (15) and John Riggins (15).

GET TRICKY

Shanahan said the Niners had the reverse flea-flicker in the game plan for a while, but had only used it once in the NFC title game last year when McCaffrey was the quarterback on the play. They did a walkthrough of the play this week that started with a handoff to McCaffrey, who handed to Samuel on a reverse before the flea-flicker to Purdy.

Shanahan got encouragement from watching Detroit score on a version of the play in the afternoon.

""We planned on calling it, but seeing it work for someone else helped,"" he said.

INJURIES/INACTIVES

Cowboys: LB Leighton Vander Esch (neck) left in the fourth quarter. ... CB C.J. Goodwin (shoulder) and Turpin (ankle) left in the first half and didn't return.

466,2023/10/09, 'director cameron',https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/cameron-ortis-trial-start-jury-1.6979981,"Cameron Ortis, the former RCMP intelligence official accused of breaking Canada's secret intelligence law, was trying to sell RCMP operational information to individuals linked to the criminal underworld — including targets of police investigations — the Crown team said in its opening remarks Tuesday.

Crown prosecutor Judy Kliewer told the jury on the first day of the trial that they would be weighing a ""highly unusual case.""



Earlier in the day, Ortis — who served as the director of the RCMP's national intelligence co-ordination centre in Ottawa at the time of his arrest — entered a not guilty plea on all charges against him. He stood tall, with his chin up, as he entered his pleas.

He faces six charges, including four counts of violating the Security of Information Act.

The 51-year-old is accused of three counts of sharing special operational information ""intentionally and without authority"" and one count of attempting to share special operational information. He also faces two Criminal Code charges: breach of trust and unauthorized use of a computer.

She told the jury that in 2013, police forces around the world were becoming increasingly concerned about criminal organizations using encrypted phones to conceal their business.

""Law enforcement around the world were going dark on criminals,"" Kliewer said.

At the time, she said, the RCMP had its eyes on a Vancouver-based company called Phantom Secure, which it believed was providing encrypted phones at a price. The force had launched Project Saturation but was making little progress, she said.

That changed in 2018 when the FBI was closing in on Vincent Ramos, the CEO of Phantom Secure Communications. When they arrested him in Las Vegas that year, Kliewer said, the RCMP was invited to go through Ramos's computer.

That's when the RCMP noticed something ""strange and alarming,"" said Kliewer.

She said the investigating officer found a 2015 email from an unnamed sender with 10 attachments he recognized as RCMP documents.

Kliewer told the jury the sender was asking for $20,000 in exchange for more information.

""It was quite evident that Mr. Ramos had received from this author information that disclosed the identity of an undercover operator that had been asked to approach Mr. Ramos's associate,"" said Kliewer.

""All of this, it's not disputed, was special operational information.""

Kliewer said it took about 18 months for police to conclude it was Ortis who had sent the documents, leading to his arrest in the fall of 2019.

But that's not where the investigation ended, Kliewer said.

She said police combed through Ortis's home and office and found an encrypted USB drive that they were able to partially decrypt.

The Crown alleges police found a folder called ""The Project,"" which included the documents sent to Ramos and scripts for communications with Ramos.

""Unfortunately, that's not all they found,"" said Kliewer.

""Police found documents, RCMP documents, emails and scripts for communications to more targets of international police investigation.""

Around 2015, Kliewer said, the Five Eyes alliance — an intelligence sharing network made up of the U.S., the U.K., Canada, Australia and New Zealand — had identified a common international threat: a money laundering network headed by Altaf Khanani.

The U.S. Treasury Board has said Khanani's organization ""launders illicit funds for organized crime groups, drug trafficking organizations, and designated terrorist groups throughout the world.""

At the time, the RCMP was investigating three people in the Toronto area who were running money service businesses and ""it was believed that they had links to the Khanani network,"" said Kliewer. One of those was a man named Farzam Mehdizadeh.

She said police found documents and scripts on the USB drive from Ortis's place sent to Khanani's associates Salim Hanareh and Muhammad Ashraf. She said they found another set of documents and a cover letter that was meant to be sent to Mehdizadeh's son.

The jury heard that an RCMP investigator was able to track down Hanareh and Ashraf and confirm the documents had been sent.

Question of authority

Kliewer told the jury that many of the facts in the case have been agreed to by both sides. Ortis is permanently bound by secrecy and there is no question that ""the information communicated was special operational information,"" she said.

""Most of what I told you is not in dispute,"" Kliewer said. ""The issue appears to be whether what he did was with authority, whether he was authorized to communicate what he did.""

Orti's lawyers have not yet made their case in court, but outside the courtroom, his lawyer Mark Ertel said his client is looking forward to testifying in the coming weeks.

""We believe he has a compelling story and that he won't be found guilty of any charges,"" Ertel said.

""He's charged with doing things without authority and we believe that we'll be able to establish that he did have authority to do everything he did.""

Kliewer said there are no records that Ortis was tasked with a covert undercover operation.

She told the jury they'll hear from his colleagues and his superiors that ""no one had any idea of what Mr. Ortis was doing by communicating to these persons in 2015.""

Kliewer also noted that Ortis was on leave for French-language training when he sent most of the anonymous emails.

Mounties could testify as witnesses

As the defendant walked into court Tuesday morning, he told reporters he felt good and smiled at the cameras.

On Tuesday morning, 12 jurors and two alternates were selected. By 2 p.m., one juror had dropped out.

Two high-profile Mounties could take the stand during the trial. Former RCMP commissioner Bob Paulson and the current commissioner, Mike Duheme, who previously oversaw federal policing, are on the witness list read out to potential jurors Tuesday morning.

The RCMP has said given his role, Ortis had access to national and multinational investigations and coveted intelligence.

""This is extremely unprecedented,"" said Jess Davis, a former analyst at the Canadian Security Intelligence Service. ""Ortis is someone who held a very high position in a very sensitive part of the RCMP.

""It's shaken the core of the public service and the security and intelligence community because this is someone who lots of people had contact with, lots of people would have had opportunity to work with.""

Davis, now president of Insight Threat Intelligence, said she'll be watching to see the evidence the Crown presents about possible motive, whether the RCMP employed proper checks and balances to protect its intelligence and how the defence makes its case.

Security of Information Act charges are rare

This will be the first time a court tests charges under the Security of Information Act.

""It's pretty groundbreaking,"" said Leah West, who practises national security law and teaches at Carleton University's Norman Paterson School of International Affairs.

""Not only is it a test case, there could be a lot of lessons learned for how to deal with intelligence-to-evidence cases in other contexts, where we want to prosecute other national security cases.""

There's only been one conviction under the Security of Information Act in the 21-year-old law's history. A Canadian naval officer pleaded guilty in 2012 to selling secrets to Russia during a preliminary hearing.

""Charges are super rare. Convictions are rare. Trials are the rarest,"" said West.

It's taken more than four years for Ortis's case to make it to trial.

He was arrested in September of 2019 and held behind bars for more than three years. He was released on bail in December under strict conditions.

Ortis's trial was held up when his original lawyer, Ian Carter, was appointed a judge to the Superior Court of Justice in Ontario in Ottawa last year. His new lawyers, Ertel and Jon Doody, needed time to catch up.

Judge has a balancing act: national security lawyer

The Federal Court had to determine which sensitive items of information could be disclosed under the Canada Evidence Act.

Davis said it's likely the public will never see the full picture, given the national security concerns.

""There's plenty of things that Canadians will just never know,"" she said.

""But we'll still get a good view of internal processes at the RCMP, a good sense of the investigation and at the end of the day, we'll get a verdict.""

West said Justice Robert Maranger will have to constantly balance the need to protect national security information with the accused's right to a fair trial.

""The judge has to balance the need to continue to protect that information that was allegedly disclosed without authorization … with the open court principle and our right as the public to understand, and the right of the accused to know all of the information that's been used against [them],"" she said.

Ortis's trial could run between four and eight weeks."

Despite some viral social media posts claiming a new California law will ban Skittles candy in 2027, there’s nothing in the law—which will ban certain food additives deemed dangerous by some studies—that will keep the popular candy off shelves.

Key Facts

Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) signed a bill into law Saturday banning four chemicals—red dye No. 3, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil and propylparaben—which are commonly used in snacks like Peeps, Brach’s candy corn and Little Debbie Cosmic Brownies. The bill has sometimes misleadingly been called a “Skittles ban” because a previous version of the bill would have banned titanium dioxide, a chemical found in Skittles candy. Though the law no longer mentions titanium dioxide, the “Skittles ban” moniker stuck, and some viral social media posts are falsely claiming California will ban Skittles candy by 2027. Skittles will remain unaffected by the ban, and even if titanium dioxide were still named in the law, companies have until 2027 to reformulate products to exclude the banned chemicals. The European Commission banned the use of titanium dioxide last year—but Skittles can still be found on shelves in Europe because the candies sold in these countries reportedly exclude the banned chemical. Newsom reportedly criticized the “Skittles ban” nickname, pointing out that other countries that have banned titanium dioxide still sell Skittles.

Surprising Fact

Though the law will not ban Skittles, claims California has outlawed the candy are running rampant on social media. A post on X from Daily Loud, a pop culture updates account with 2.5 million followers, falsely stated “California will officially ban Skittles and other candies from the state starting 2027.” The misinformed post was liked more than 68,000 times and viewed more than 15 million times. Actor and television host Mario Lopez reposted a false claim that the state will ban Skittles, stating: “Crime is through the roof, worst drug epidemic ever & homelessness at an all time high in CA… Let’s focus on Skittles.” A YouTube video by right-wing personality The Quartering, viewed 50,000 times, falsely stated Skittles was banned by California’s “woke leaders.”

Crucial Quote

“There’s a zero percent chance this is actually going to result in a ban of Skittles,” California state Rep. Jesse Gabriel, who introduced the bill, said. “All we want the companies to do is switch their recipes in the same way that they've done in Europe, and Canada and the U.K. and Brazil and other countries that have banned these chemicals.”

Key Background

Some studies have linked red dye No. 3 to thyroid cancer in animals, though no studies have linked the chemical to cancer in humans. The Food and Drug Administration banned the chemical in 1990 for cosmetic uses based on the link to cancer in animals, but still permitted it in food products. Brominated vegetable oil has been found to harm skin membranes and, in large quantities, has been linked to memory loss. Some studies have suggested propylparaben can interfere with fertility, and one study found it decreased sperm count in rats, though some recent research did not find a link between fertility issues in rats and propylparaben. Some research has found potassium bromate can have carcinogenic effects in animals. The European Food Safety Authority said in 2022 titanium dioxide is “possibly carcinogenic,” but some researchers have disputed this and called for further research.

Big Number

12,000. That’s about how many food products may be affected by California’s new law, according to an Environmental Working Group report.

469,2023/10/10, 'kraken',https://www.nhl.com/kraken/news/final-buzzer-seattle-kraken-at-vegas-golden-knights-oct-10,"Another positive: The Kraken penalty killers posted a clean sheet, shutting down potent VGK power play units twice, one each in the first two periods of play. Meanwhile, after Vegas outchanced the visitors 8 to 4 in Grade-A scoring opportunities during the first period, Seattle rebounded with five high-dangers chances compared to three for Vegas, per Natural Stat Trick.

Power Outage, Late-Game Missed Opportunity

Seattle managed four shots in six minutes of power play time in the first 40 minutes, not a ratio that will satisfy Dave Hakstolâs goal to do better than 21st in the NHL last season, an intention the Kraken coach has mentioned often when asked about power play work in the preseason. The Kraken did generate six shots on a five-minute power play in the finalÂ but VGK goalie Adin Hill made the saves when needed.

Ultimately, we didn't capitalize when we had the good opportunities, whether it be five on five or on the power play,â said Hakstol. âThe positive is we generated some of those opportunities. The flip side of it is they generated chances as well. They're a good team in terms of transition and off the rush and we saw that on their first goal. We made a mistake and that was their first opportunity.â

The Kraken power play got the chance to redeem matters with a five-minute major called on Vegasâ illegal hit to the head on Brandon Tanev, who also appeared to have a knee twisted as he fell to the ice. Jordan Eberle had a close-in chance early in the five minutes but Adin Hill shut it down and his shot blockers stemmed all attempts. One PK standout for Vegas on the evening: Nicholas Roy, who was originally drafted by Ron Francis when he was GM in Carolina.

âThe big one is the power play,â said Eberle when discussing how the game could have turned in the Krakenâs favor after early aggressive play from Seattle. âWeâve got to find a way to get a timely goal there, to find a way to get us back. We had lots of chances.""

âThe power play, especially early in the year, is such a huge thing. Last year we had it going early and it carried us. This group is more than capable, we have a lot of skill. This group we can find a way to do it.âÂ

First Shot and First Period Woes

After the Kraken took the first five shots on goal in Tuesdayâs season opener during the gameâs first seven minutes, including a tantalizing open look for Andre Burakovsky stopped by Vegas goalie Adin Hill, the home squadâs second line worked a tic-tac-toe play to beat Philipp Grubauer. On literally a banner night for Vegas, the crowd boomed yet again as captain Mark Stone worked the puck to linemate Brett Howden, who zipped a spot-on pass to center Chandler Stephensonâs stick blade and past a sprawling Grubauer while sliding right to left.

It needs to be quickly added that Grubauer proceeded to make several saves on threatening shots and scoring chances to keep his teammates in this 2023-24 opener and its two standings points still in reach. Prime example: Grubauer turned away a Grade-A scoring chance by the aforementioned Stephenson just outside the crease at the 11-minute mark just after the Kraken had come up empty on a second early-game power play.

But with five minutes left and fourth-liner Brandon Tanev appearing to have intercepted a VGK centering pass in the Seattle end and primed to clear it, he bladed the puck back toward the end boards and last springâs Vegas playoff MVP Jonathan Marchessault smartly and successfully poke-checked the puck to tip it past an understandably unsuspecting Grubauer. Two-nothing bad guys and a lead not surrendered on the night.

To his credit, Grubauer maintained his trademark calm presence to make one more monster save among 10 VGK shots on goal in the first period. He smothered a point-blank netfront shot by Michael Amadio with two minutes in the opening frame.

Third-Period Troubling for Tanev

Not the best of outings for fan favorite Brandon Tanev. Beyond the own goal of sorts in the first period, Tanev suffered a flush-on head hit in which a knee also appeared to twist. Tanev immediately left the ice for the Kraken locker room. There was no immediate update on his condition. Check back on the Kraken app and website for updates. Vegas forward Brett Howden was whistled for a five-minute major for an illegal hit to the head but the Kraken could not convert on the power play. Vegas center Jack Eichel sealed this matchup with a late goal."

Retton has been diagnosed with “a very rare form of pneumonia” and has been in the ICU at an undisclosed hospital for more than a week “not able to breathe on her own”, McKenna Kelley said in an Instagram story posted on Tuesday afternoon.

“Out of respect for her and her privacy, I will not disclose all details,” wrote Kelley, a former gymnast at Louisiana State University. “However, I will disclose that she is not insured.”

She added: “We ask that if you could help in any way, that 1) you PRAY! and 2) if you could help us with finances for the hospital bill.”

Retton, 55, won five medals at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, including a gold in the all-around competition – the first individual Olympic gymnastics medal ever won by an American – scoring a perfect 10 on the vault in the final rotation. The West Virginia native’s performance landed her on the front of Wheaties boxes and keyed the sport’s explosion in popularity in the United States.

After her gymnastics career, Retton remained active in the media, appearing in a number of films and TV shows. She was inducted into the International Gymnastics Hall of Fame in 1997 and was the first woman to be selected into the Houston Sports Hall of Fame in 2020.

Retton also served on the President’s Council on Physical Fitness and Sports under US president George W Bush."

473,2023/10/10, 'diamondbacks',https://www.espn.com/mlb/recap/_/gameId/401581138,"LOS ANGELES -- — Not many people picked the Arizona Diamondbacks to beat Milwaukee in the NL Wild Card Series. Even fewer pegged them to take down the 100-win Los Angeles Dodgers in the Division Series.

Surprise! After a rough ending to the regular season, the upstart youngsters from the desert are sailing through the playoffs.

Lourdes Gurriel Jr. and the Diamondbacks made quick work of another Dodgers starter, beating Los Angeles 4-2 on Monday night behind Zac Gallen for a 2-0 lead in their NLDS.

“Why would we play with anything to lose?” closer Paul Sewald said. “We were the sixth seed. We weren’t supposed to win in Milwaukee. No one is going to pick us to beat the Dodgers when we haven’t played well against them. We’re going out there with a lot of confidence.”

The D-backs, who earned the final National League wild card despite losing their last four regular-season games, improved to 4-0 in these playoffs — all on the road against division winners. They were 5-8 against the Dodgers during the regular season, losing the final five meetings.

“These guys are very hungry and they feel like they have a lot to prove,” Arizona manager Torey Lovullo said.

They'll try for a stunning sweep of the NL West champions when the best-of-five series shifts to Phoenix for Game 3 on Wednesday.

“It’s two games, but our backs are against the wall,” Dodgers manager Dave Roberts said. “We’ve got to make some type of adjustments and we have no more margin.”

Gallen allowed two runs over 5 1/3 innings for his second win of the postseason. Gurriel laced an RBI single to cap a three-run first, and the Diamondbacks chased rookie starter Bobby Miller in the second.

“I don’t think it’s any secret we’ve come in here and struggled,” Gallen said. “It was good for us just mentally to come in here and set the tone, have a little faith in ourselves.”

The early outburst came two nights after Los Angeles ace Clayton Kershaw was tagged for six runs while getting only one out during Arizona's 11-2 rout in Game 1.

Gurriel added a solo homer in the sixth to make it 4-1. Sewald pitched a perfect ninth for his third save of the postseason, aided by a nice catch from Gurriel in left field.

Gallen retired nine in a row during one stretch in his second career postseason start. The 17-game winner gave up five hits, struck out four and walked two.

Arizona’s hitters weren’t intimidated by Miller's 100 mph heat in his playoff debut. They loaded the bases with nobody out and got a sacrifice fly from Christian Walker and an RBI groundout from Gabriel Moreno before Gurriel's two-out single made it 3-0.

Kershaw and Miller worked a combined two innings and gave up nine earned runs. Miller allowed four hits, struck out one and walked two in 1 2/3 innings before Roberts had seen enough and went to the bullpen.

“Especially after losing Game 1, you want to go out there and set a tone for your offense and get them in a good mood,” Miller said. “Stuff happens. We’re not done yet. They’ve still got to win another game. I know we can do this.”

Kershaw and Miller have a combined 40.50 ERA through the first two games — the worst starters' ERA over that span in postseason history, according to ESPN Stats & Info.

The Dodgers have lost five straight postseason games dating to Game 2 of last year’s NLDS against San Diego.

Once again, the Dodgers got little production from the top of their lineup. Mookie Betts and Freddie Freeman, two of the team’s four 100-RBI players, were a combined 1 for 13 with three walks and a strikeout in the first two games of the series.

“All of us gotta get going,"" Betts said. ""We had a couple opportunities and we didn’t cash it in. For me and Freddie, that’s kind of our role. We’re not doing it, and I take ownership in that. Gotta figure out a way, man. No excuses.”

Los Angeles went 2 for 12 with runners in scoring position during the two games and stranded 13 overall.

Despite having the sellout crowd behind him from his first pitch, Miller issued a leadoff walk to Corbin Carroll. Ketel Marte reached on a bunt single and Tommy Pham singled to load the bases.

James Outman crashed into the center-field wall making a leaping catch of Walker’s sacrifice fly that scored Carroll for a 1-0 lead. Outman bobbled a catch in the first inning of Game 1 that contributed to Kershaw’s six-run inning before the three-time Cy Young Award winner was yanked.

After Pham stole second, Arizona added two more runs on Moreno’s RBI groundout to shortstop and Gurriel's sharp single to center.

Miller had two-strike counts on seven hitters and retired only three of them. He needed 32 pitches to get through the first after visits by catcher Will Smith and pitching coach Mark Prior.

J.D. Martinez hit a solo homer in the fourth that pulled the Dodgers to 3-1. They had runners at the corners in the fifth, but with the crowd chanting “Freddie! Freddie!,” Freeman took a called third strike to end the inning.

“Couple pitches I missed that will make me not sleep,” Freeman said.

The Dodgers chased Gallen with back-to-back singles by Max Muncy and Martinez in the sixth. Andrew Saalfrank, a September callup, walked pinch-hitter Chris Taylor to load the bases.

Pinch-hitter Kiké Hernández bounced the ball over the mound and second baseman Marte made a diving stop as Muncy scored to make it 4-2. Outman struck out and pinch-hitter Kolten Wong grounded out against side-armer Ryan Thompson with the bases loaded to end the inning.

Betts reached on a fielding error by Thompson leading off the seventh, and Freeman came to the plate as the potential tying run. He fouled a ball off the inside of his right leg before hitting into a double play, and Smith ended the inning by taking a called third strike.

""That’s what happens when you take a terrible swing. You hurt yourself,” Freeman said, laughing.

CARROLL'S NUMBERS

Carroll singled in the seventh and finished 1 for 2 with a run and three walks. The rookie leadoff hitter is batting .500 with two homers and four RBI in four postseason games.

DIGGING THE LONG BALL

Arizona has homered in 15 straight postseason games dating to Game 3 of the 2007 NL Championship Series against Colorado, tied for the second-longest streak in playoff history.

UP NEXT

Diamondbacks rookie RHP Brandon Pfaadt is scheduled to start Game 3. He started Game 1 of the Wild Card Series in Milwaukee.

The Dodgers will go with RHP Lance Lynn. He gave up a major league-leading 44 homers during the season, when he had a 7-2 record and a 4.36 ERA after joining the Dodgers before the Aug. 1 trade deadline.

474,2023/10/10, 'amazon prime day',https://www.kiplinger.com/personal-finance/online-shopping/five-reasons-you-shouldnt-shop-on-amazon-prime-day,"Many bargain hunters are counting down the minutes to the start of Amazon's first-ever Prime Big Deal Days, slated for October 10 and 11. The members-only mega-sale promises deep discounts on thousands of products. But are Amazon's blink-and-you-miss-them lightning deals worth the hype? Based on past complaints about checkout glitches and inventory shortages, plus the availability of bigger sales at other times of the year, savvy shoppers might be better offer taking a pass on Prime Big Deal Days altogether.

1. You must be an Amazon Prime member to access deals

Not a Prime member? Unless you have yet to take advantage of Amazon's 30-day free trial (longer for students), you'll have to fork over $139 to cover the annual membership fee before gaining access to the exclusive deals on October 10.

But if you're considering joining Prime just to shop on Prime Big Deal Days, think twice before committing. If you don't plan to frequent Amazon often enough to reap the savings of Prime's free two-day shipping or to utilize the other member benefits (streaming music and videos are among the most popular), it could be a waste of your money.

2. Popular items sells out fast

In years past, one of the top complaints from shoppers on Amazon Prime Day has been that highly coveted items such as TVs and laptops were only available in limited quantities and sold out too quickly. As a result, you might be tempted to buy something else. But don’t be tempted to grab an item simply because it’s cheap.

Amazon is upfront about the limited quantities on Prime Day, but it's still a letdown if you wait hours for your item to go on sale only to find it's unavailable when you try to add it to your shopping cart. Once a product is sold out at the sale price, Amazon won't always restock right away and when it does restock, the sale price likely won't be offered.

3. You're an indecisive shopper

Keep in mind that if you're an indecisive shopper — say, you're someone who lets a desired item sit in their online shopping cart for a day or two before deciding if you really want to buy it — you should probably skip Prime Big Deal Days. Since the best deals don't last long, and new deals come online as often as every five minutes, you'll need to be ready to act fast if something catches your eye.

4. You're an impulse shopper

If you like to window shop and get easily lured into buying something you don't need simply because it's on sale (let's be honest, does anyone really need a toilet bowl light?), then you'll want to steer clear of Amazon Prime Big Deal Days. It could be too tempting.

Remember, this is a sale where shoppers who are keeping a close eye on deal updates will be inundated for 48 hours straight. Before you buy something, calculate how much an amount you spend today could be worth in the future if you invested the money or paid down debt.

You don’t have to buy things just because they are on sale. Spending today means less to spend tomorrow. Don't buy something just to get the thrill of a bargain or because you get caught-up in the hype of a sale. The letdown will be worse than the fear of missing out.

5. There are better sales from other retailers and at other times of the year

Amazon had a great idea and, fortunately for shoppers, the idea has caught on and there are sales everywhere. Other retailers have wised up and used the frenzy that surrounds Amazon's sales days to their own advantage. So don't limit yourself to just Amazon. There are deals everywhere.

Walmart’s Deals Holiday Kickoff begins at 7 p.m. ET on Oct. 9 and runs through Oct. 12. This sale isn't exclusive to Walmart Plus members, so all shoppers can access the deals. Expect discounts on giftable items like electronics and apparel.

Best Buy has a 48-Hour Flash Sale on Oct. 10-11. They plan to offer hundreds of deals on TVs and laptops, headphones and smartwatches. Electric transportation items, such as scooters and e-bikes, will also be part of the sale.

Black Friday and Cyber Monday are the deal day of all deal days. And they are only seven weeks away. Retailers that don't normally have sales, such as beauty brands and sometimes even Apple, have offers that won't be available at any other time of year."
475,2023/10/11,'scalise',https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/06/politics/steve-scalise-profile-house-speaker-race/index.html,"CNN —

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise has risen through the ranks of leadership during his time in Congress. Next, the Louisiana Republican hopes to be elected House speaker.

In the position of House majority leader, Scalise has served as the second-highest-ranking House Republican after Kevin McCarthy. Now House Republicans have selected him as the nominee for speaker after McCarthy was pushed out of the top leadership role in a historic vote.

McCarthy’s ouster and decision not to run again for speaker stunned House Republicans and threatens to intensify bitter divisions within the conference. While Scalise won the nomination over Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan on Wednesday in a 113 to 99 vote, it remains unclear if the caucus will be able to coalesce around a successor and meet the 217-vote threshold to secure the speaker’s gavel.

Jordan had gained a key endorsement from former President Donald Trump on Friday.

Scalise and Jordan both supported objections to electoral college results when Congress met to certify Joe Biden’s presidential win on January 6, 2021, the same day a pro-Trump mob attacked the Capitol seeking to overturn the election.

Scalise is a prominent figure in the House GOP conference and has long been seen as either a potential successor, or rival, to McCarthy. Before he became majority leader, Scalise served as House GOP whip, a role focused on vote counting and ensuring support for key party priorities. The majority leader, his current role, oversees the House floor and schedules legislation for votes.

The Louisiana Republican is no stranger to adversity – which he alluded to in announcing his bid for speaker.

A shooting in 2017 left him seriously wounded, with a grueling, monthslong recovery process. Scalise was shot by a gunman who opened fire as congressional Republicans were practicing for an annual charity baseball game.

In August, Scalise announced that he had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma, which he described as “a very treatable blood cancer.” In September, Scalise told reporters that in response to treatment, his cancer “has dropped dramatically.”

In a letter to colleagues asking for their support in the speaker’s race, Scalise referenced the shooting as well as “new challenges.”

“I firmly believe this conference is a family. When I was shot in 2017, it was members of this conference who saved my life on that field,” he said.

“I love this country, and I believe we were sent here to come together and solve the immense challenges we face. As I face new challenges, I feel even more strongly about that today.”

Scalise was elected to Congress in 2008 and represents Louisiana’s First Congressional District. He previously served in the Louisiana state legislature and holds a degree in computer science.

In 2014, Scalise faced intense blowback for having given a speech in 2002 to a White supremacist group founded by former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke. Scalise apologized and said in a statement that speaking to the group “was a mistake I regret, and I emphatically oppose the divisive racial and religious views groups like these hold.”"

""Hey everyone! On behalf of my sisters and I, we need y'all's help,"" Kelley wrote. ""My amazing mom, Mary Lou, has a very rare form of pneumonia and is fighting for her life. She is not able to breathe on her own. She's been in the ICU for over a week now.""

Kelley revealed that her mother is not insured.

""Out of respect for her and her privacy, I will not disclose all details. However, I will disclose that she is not insured,"" she continued. ""We ask that if you could help in any way, that 1) you PRAY! and 2) if you could help us with finances for the hospital bill.""

Kelley started a fundraiser on Spotfund to help pay for medical expenses as she wrote her mother is currently not able to breathe on her own. More than $52,000 dollars has been raised by Tuesday evening, surpassing the fundraising goal of $50,000.

""ANYTHING, absolutely anything, would be so helpful for my family and my mom. Thank y'all so very much!"" she added.

In 1984, Retton became the first American woman ever to win the individual all-around gold medal at the Olympics. The 55-year-old retired in 1986 and in the years since, she has been focused on health, fitness and raising her four daughters."

The 32-year-old actress and singer and her pro partner, Alan Bersten, were sent packing during the Oct. 4 Latin night episode after scoring a 16 for their cha-cha.

Meanwhile, singer-songwriter Jason Mraz and Marvel star Xochitl Gomez -- along with their respective pro partners, Daniella Karagach and Val Chmerkovskiy -- tied for the top spot of the leaderboard with scores of 24.

Read on for more about ""DWTS"" week 2.

Spears reflects on her 'DWTS' experience

After her elimination, Spears said the thing she will miss the most about being on the show is ""working with Alan.""

""I'm proud of you,"" Bersten said as he hugged Spears.

Spears added that there were ""a lot of great parts"" about taking part on ""DWTS,"" but said the best was ""meeting everybody and learning so much and doing something I never thought I would do in my entire life.""

Judge Derek Hough called Spears' elimination ""quite surprising"" and ""a shocker, honestly.""

On social media following the episode, Spears called Bersten ""the absolute best friend and partner that anyone could ever ask for.""

She added, ""I got to raise some money for my #SAGAFTRA community and meet some of the most amazing ppl, and That's a win by all accounts in what I set out to do.""

Spears called it ""an amazing experience"" and wished her ""fabulous"" fellow competitors well as they ""continue to KILL it each week!!!!!""

Top scores of the night

As previously mentioned, Mraz and Gomez took the top spots of the night for their respective dances. Mraz and Karagach stunned with their rumba to ""Quizás, Quizás, Quizás"" by Andrea Bocelli featuring Jennifer Lopez while Gomez and Chmerkovskiy wowed with a salsa to ""Don't Go Yet"" by Camila Cabello.

""Last week felt like being shot out of a cannon,"" Mraz said during rehearsal, saying he was ""elated"" with the results from the premiere.

Karagach pointed out that this week's routine brought a new challenge for them since the style is a slower dance that leaves ""a lot of room for error"" as opposed to last week's high-energy routine.

""Week one, we set a high bar,"" Mraz said. ""Now there's this expectation that we're great and I don't know if I am.""

Coming close behind were ""Bachelorette"" alum Charity Lawson and Ezra Sosa -- who was filling in for Artem Chigvintsev after he tested positive for COVID-19 -- and social media star Lele Pons and Brandon Armstrong, who scored 21s for their cha-cha and samba, respectively.

Lowest scores of the night

Spears, despite being eliminated, was not the lowest scoring celebrity of the night. That spot belonged to real estate broker Mauricio Umansky, husband of ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star Kyle Richards, whose salsa with pro partner Emma Slater earned him a 12.

Emma Slater, MAauricio Umansky perform on ""Dancing with the Stars"" on ABC, Oct. 3, 2023. Christopher Willard/ABC

Umansky said during rehearsal he was ""extremely disappointed"" to be in the bottom two last week and that he felt ""the pressure is on to deliver"" or else he'd get the boot.

""Week one was intense. I was really down. Learning how to dance has been an absolutely incredible thing for me right now with everything I'm going through at home,"" he said.

Slater told him they needed to ""keep pushing forward"" and put their heart and soul out there in order to stage a comeback.

In a three-way tie for the spot above Umansky were NFL star Adrian Peterson and Britt Stewart, ""The Brady Bunch"" alum Barry Williams and Peta Murgatroyd and reality star and social personality Harry Jowsey and Rylee Arnold all scoring 15s for their dance routines.

Maybe every major UFC card should be left blank until a couple of weeks before fight night. Last-minute matchmaking sure has worked wonders for UFC 294.

For months, the promotion had been building a potent lineup for Saturday's return to Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates. The main event would be a rematch between UFC lightweight champion Islam Makhachev and Charles Oliveira, who owned the belt until Makhachev took it away the last time the UFC was in Abu Dhabi, a year ago at UFC 280. The co-main would be the first appearance in over a year for once-skyrocketing-but-lately-grounded-not-in-the-good-way Khamzat Chimaev, moving up to middleweight to face onetime title challenger Paulo Costa. It appeared we were in for an entertaining conclusion to an evening of fisticuffs.

But last Wednesday, 11 days before the first punch was to be thrown, both headlining fights evaporated into thin air. Oliveira revealed he had suffered a bad cut above his right eye in training. Costa reported that he had undergone surgery on his right elbow. Both were out. So much for building our hopes up.

Never fear, fight fans. UFC matchmakers went right to work with their patch-up-the-holes kit. And within hours, they had pieced together an even mightier 1-2 punch for the top of the UFC 294 marquee (ESPN+ PPV, 2 p.m. ET; prelims on ESPN+, 10 a.m.).

Makhachev will move from one rematch to another, this time with a far more competitive two-to-tango partner, Alexander Volkanovski. The last fight ended with the featherweight champ on top of a knocked-down, tuckered-out Makhachev, dropping punches as the horn sounded to end Round 5 of their lightweight superfight at UFC 284 in February. Moments later, Makhachev was the one getting his hand raised as the winner of a unanimous decision to retain his title. But Volkanovski had been so impressive that he, not Makhachev, sits on top of the ESPN men's pound-for-pound rankings. Can't wait to see Round 6 and beyond from No. 1 and No. 2.

This weekend's co-main event experienced an even grander upgrade, as it now features a fighter who spent a considerable time in that No. 1 pound-for-pound slot. Kamaru Usman, the former longtime welterweight champ, stepped in to offer Chimaev what looks like the stiffest test of his undefeated career. And Chimaev vehemently accepted the challenge. Much respect to both of them for agreeing to a last-minute matchup against an unknown, in a clash that seems sure to redirect at least one of their careers abruptly.

And also much respect to the matchmakers who overcame not one, but two, major fight cancellations. Talk about battling through adversity and coming up big.

Let's break down this weekend's narratives:

Makhachev vs. Volkanovski 2: A better main event

Makhachev-Oliveira 2 could have been exciting. Before losing his belt to Makhachev, Oliveira had won 11 fights in a row and was coming off finishes of Michael Chandler, Dustin Poirier and Justin Gaethje. The former champ has more UFC submissions (16) than anyone ever, making him among the most dangerous grapplers in the game. But we cannot ignore what we saw when he tussled with Makhachev. The Dagestani took Oliveira down repeatedly, battered him bloody, and finished him via make-it-look-easy submission.

By contrast, Makhachev's fight with Volkanovski ended with the Aussie looking like a winner. Don't get me wrong: Makhachev deserved to be the one getting his hand raised. He was in command for most of the fight's 25 minutes, building a lead on the judges' scorecards with takedowns in each of the first four rounds and much-accumulated control time. But Volkanovski kept coming. And here's the visual that lingers from the fight's conclusion: a heavy-breathing Makhachev holding on to survive an onslaught by his tireless challenger. No sooner did the final horn sound when social media lit up with ""Encore! Encore!"" And now we'll have it.

Usman vs. Chimaev: A way better co-main

Even if Costa were at full strength, instead of being just a few weeks removed from surgery, Usman still would be a significant upgrade. He is MMA history's greatest 170-pounder this side of Georges St-Pierre. Before losing his title to Leon Edwards last year, Usman had won 15 fights in a row, the longest streak ever for a UFC welterweight and the second longest overall in promotion history. He can strike and grapple. Just like Chimaev.

They're fighting at middleweight, a division Chimaev has fought several times. The strapping Costa, who competed at light heavyweight just two fights ago, would have put Chimaev to a heftier test. But Usman, a career welterweight, also has a good measure of physicality in him. And he has the skills and savvy to put Chimaev in deeper waters than he's ever swam in.

Glass half-empty: Short notice could make performances come up short

Eleven days' notice does not mean fighters have nearly two weeks to prepare. Serious gym time came down to five days, ending Monday morning. From here on out, fighters will devote much of their time to carrying around huge jugs of water as part of a weight cut while they fulfill fight-hyping obligations in interviews with MMA media and news conferences. I wouldn't wish either of those duties on anyone.

Makhachev and Volkanovski have tangled before, so there's reason to believe -- and hope -- they can pick up where they left off. But there's a lingering concern that a short-notice booking might not offer us the best encore we could get. Are we wasting one of the great rematches of our time by not allowing it to fully marinate? Or by not letting the fighters prepare accordingly for such a fierce contest?

The stakes for Chimaev and Usman, even with no belt on the line, could be more dramatic. Will Chimaev's full-tilt rise toward what seemed an inevitable title shot run into a brick wall? Will Usman, who dropped his belt to Edwards in August 2022 and also lost the rematch in March, see his skid reach three in a row? Settling such pivotal matters with little preparation seems ill-advised, even foolhardy. But the show must go on.

Glass half-full: Short-notice variables ramp up the intrigue

The purist in me wants every title fight to pit No. 1 in a weight class against No. 2 in that same division, for them to fight at a neutral site that's not far above sea level, and for each participant to enter the cage having had a fruitful, incident-free training camp.

Yep, that's what I want. Secure both guys in bubble wrap during fight week just to make sure.

If I held to my standards, though, do you know how many big fights I'd see? Zero.

Stuff happens. Practically every major fight has some sort of playing-field-tilting X-factor. And I reluctantly must acknowledge that unexpected twists add to the drama of the sport.

I'm no fan of the manufactured, WWE-style melodrama of weigh-in shoving and press conference verbal sparring, especially when the insults veer in ugly directions. I'm more interested in the drama that unfolds organically, such as what we've already seen with UFC 294. Nothing was scripted about Oliveira's eyebrow cut during a regular sparring session, Costa's elbow surgery, the chest-thumping step-ups by Volkanovski and Usman, the never-say-no welcoming by Makhachev and Chimaev.

The drama surrounding these two fights transcends the matchups and how they rate against the original ones. The drama surrounding these two fights is intensified by the circumstances of four athletes, each taking on a career-defining challenge with little time to prepare for it.

If these were typical fights with typical readiness, those of us who follow the sport could have reasonably informed opinions about who will win. But the last-minute matchmaking has added a disorienting variable.

Will the ill effects of the short notice become apparent during either fight? In whose performance? And who will own the night?

We might think we know, but we don't. We can only stand back and watch, ready to be surprised."

HOUSTON -- You hear it so often at playoff time that the words take on the form of the cliche: The team that wins the big moments wins in the postseason.

For two games over two nights in the ALCS, and for seven games since the playoffs began, the Texas Rangers have won just about all of the big moments that have come their way this October.

Texas was at it again Monday, winning a nail-biting 5-4 decision in Game 2 at Minute Maid Park that puts the Houston Astros in the kind of postseason hole they've rarely been in during their seven-season run of October dominance.

""I think that's what makes baseball special,"" said Rangers catcher Jonah Heim, who clanged a homer in Game 2 off a metallic sign above the Crawford Boxes. ""You never know who's going to win the big moment.""

While the Rangers haven't faced this kind of pressure cooker as a group before, a number of their key performers have been there and done that during their careers. One of those seasoned standouts is Texas Game 2 starter Nathan Eovaldi, who won his seventh career playoff game.

Texas gave Eovaldi an early margin to work with, jumping on Houston starter Framber Valdez for four runs in the first inning and chasing the lefty after 2⅔ innings. Texas built a 5-1 lead before Houston started chipping away.

Eovaldi wavered at times, giving up solo homers to Yordan Alvarez and Alex Bregman. The game appeared to be on the verge of flipping Houston's way in the fifth, when Michael Brantley and Chas McCormick singled. Josh Jung, who otherwise put up a highlight-reel performance in the field at third base, misplayed a slow Jeremy Pena grounder.

Bases jammed, no one out, the Rangers clinging to a 5-2 lead. These are the moments the Astros have won so often over the years during their streak of seven straight ALCS appearance that has included two World Series titles and four pennants.

""I feel like in those big moments you've got to bear down and make big pitches,"" Eovaldi said. ""The stadium is crazy. You have all the fans and everything going nuts. But at the same time you try to simplify everything down to your strengths and what you do best.""

In this instance, pulling off an escape that would make Houdini jealous is what Eovaldi did best. Eovaldi won the moment, striking out Yanier Diaz and Jose Altuve, then getting Bregman on a chopper to third. Threat extinguished.

""That was the turning point in the game,"" Rangers manager Bruce Bochy said. ""Found a way to get through it. And terrific job by [Eovaldi]. He had good stuff today. He pitched very well.""

Eovaldi departed after gutting out six innings, allowing three runs and striking out nine. He has now struck out 23 batters over three 2023 playoff starts and for his postseason career is 7-3 with a 2.87 ERA over 14 appearances, including eight starts.

The next big moment arose in the bottom of the eighth against the Texas bullpen. Alvarez mashed his second homer of the game and sixth of the postseason, taking lefty Aroldis Chapman deep to trim the Rangers' lead to one run.

With the orange towel-waving fans in Houston worked into a frenzy, anticipating the kind of climatic moment they've come to expect from the Astros, Bochy decided to insert closer Jose Leclerc for a possible four-out save, one of the first instances this October in which the manager has pushed one of his relievers.

""I didn't really think about [four outs],"" Leclerc said via a team interpreter. ""I just had to get one out, then three more outs.""

Bochy, in pursuit of his fourth World Series title as a manager, has guided as many teams through big moments as anyone. But it appeared that he might have made the wrong call for once when Leclerc started off wild, walking both Jose Abreu and Brantley. Surely this was the tipping-point moment for the inevitable Astros.

Instead, Leclerc got McCormick to reach for a slider down in the zone. McCormick chopped it at Jung. The rookie third baseman has excelled with the glove all season but also missed time in September because of a thumb injury that still requires him to wear a guard on his glove hand.

""It hit off my little thumb guard,"" Jung said. ""Just hit right off there and popped up in the air. I didn't panic or anything.""

That's how it played out, with the ball deflecting off Jung's glove and suspending in the air for what felt like a long time. Jung simply gathered it back in and stepped on the third-base bag for the forceout, ending the inning.

Leclerc was back out for the ninth and after Pena flied out to the wall in right, Jung went to his knees to smother a sharp Diaz grounder and threw across for the second out. That brought up perennial postseason hero Jose Altuve.

But this was the Rangers' moment, too: Altuve reached for a Leclerc offering and flied out harmlessly to center. Leclerc said, ""I'd didn't have my best stuff,"" but his stuff was good enough for the bend-but-don't-break Rangers.

""We had balls bounce our way a couple of times and we've made some really good plays defensively,"" Heim said. ""I think that makes us who we are.""

Now the Rangers are getting into historical territory. Texas has reeled off seven straight wins to start the playoffs, including six on the road. Only the 2014 Royals had a longer streak (eight games) to begin a postseason. Only the 2005 White Sox had a longer road win streak (eight) within the same postseason.

Perhaps more importantly, the Rangers have pushed the Astros into a corner from which they've rarely had to respond. Only once in 14 series since 2017 has Houston hosted the first two games of a matchup and lost both.

But the Rangers would be well served to recall what the Astros did when they last faced an 0-2 hole with three games looming on the road. In the 2019 World Series, Houston dropped two straight games to the Nationals at Minute Maid. They then traveled to Washington and won three straight.

Game 3 is slated for Wednesday at Globe Life Field. Texas will send ace Max Scherzer to the mound for his first action of the postseason. Houston will start righty Cristian Javier.

Anyone expecting the Astros to panic now will probably be disappointed. After seven years of excellence, the Rangers can expect an opponent that still very much expects to win.

""You treat it like the game of baseball,"" said Bregman, whose homer gave him 17 career playoff long balls and 50 postseason RBIs for the Astros. ""You got to continue to play and have that next-pitch mentality. So true too. We've seen what this October has been like, and sometimes things don't make sense."""
480,2023/10/11, 'connor bedard',https://www.nbcsports.com/nhl/news/connor-bedard-picks-up-an-assist-in-his-nhl-debut-as-the-blackhawks-rally-past-crosby-penguins-4-2,"PITTSBURGH (AP) Connor Bedard skated into the faceoff circle, saw one of his idols standing across from him and tried to soak in the moment.

That really was Sidney Crosby within arm’s reach. That really was referee Kelly Sutherland welcoming him to the NHL on national television. That really was a sellout crowd pulling cameras out trying to capture the meeting of two generational talents at opposite ends of their careers.

Then the puck dropped, and the instincts that have made the 18-year-old Bedard the NHL’s next big thing kicked in.

Playing with a charismatic fearlessness, Bedard dazzled in Chicago’s 4-2 comeback win over Crosby and the Penguins on Tuesday night.

The top pick in the draft picked up an assist and fired five shots at Tristan Jarry while playing 21:29, hardly looking intimidated by the stage, the stakes or pretty much anything else.

“I think, for me, it’s just trying to get better every shift, every game,” Bedard said. “I created a bit. There’s obviously things I can get better at. But felt pretty good.”

Looked pretty good too. Penguins defenseman Kris Letang gave Bedard a couple of “welcome to the NHL hits,” not in an attempt to send a message but because at times it was the only way to keep up with Bedard.

“He’s so good, so shifty,” Letang said. “He’s got great moves. I had to play him hard. He’s really deceptive. You can’t even look at the puck one second, because he’s so fast.”

Chicago trailed 2-0 when Crosby began his 19th season by scoring his 551st career goal, a shot into an open net off a pass from Jake Guentzel 11:56 into the second period.

The Blackhawks roared back behind a goal from Ryan Donato - with a secondary assist from Bedard - in the second period and Cole Guttman’s goal midway through the third. Jason Dickinson gave Chicago the lead with 4:31 remaining. Nick Foligno’s empty-netter with 1:33 to go sent most of the sellout crowd that came to watch one of the NHL’s brightest stars take on one of its newest home.

“I feel like that was a complete game,” Dickinson said. “We played the full 60. We stuck to our game plan. We played a hard game. It’s nice when you get rewarded.”

Petr Mrazek stopped 38 shots for the Blackhawks.

Crosby and Bryan Rust scored for the Penguins, who had their run of 16 consecutive playoff appearances end last spring thanks in part to a late-season pratfall against the Blackhawks. Pittsburgh retooled over the summer, including adding three-time Norris Trophy-winning defenseman Erik Karlsson.

Fireworks, however, were hard to come by for the NHL’s oldest team. Jarry made 32 saves but the Penguins let a lead slip away late, a problem that plagued them at times last season.

“First game, I don’t think anybody is firing on all cylinders at this point,” Crosby said. “There are certainly some things we can do better, be more detailed defensively.”

Bedard’s arrival in the NHL had been anticipated for years, much like Crosby’s when the Penguins grabbed him with the top overall selection in 2005, all of 13 days after Bedard was born. His arrival in Chicago has given the beleaguered franchise a much-needed jolt even though there almost certainly will be some growing pains on a team that’s missed the playoffs five of the last six seasons as the dynasty that won three Stanley Cups between 2010-15 faded.

Like Crosby, Bedard seems at ease with the attention that has followed him from childhood prodigy to the NHL. He joked during the morning skate that he slept “like a baby.” He sprinted onto the ice with fellow Blackhawks rookie Kevin Korchinski during warmups, the two teenagers having the rink to themselves momentarily as is tradition for players making their NHL debuts.

Bedard was fidgety during the national anthem, his legs in constant motion, eager to get a moment he’d been dreaming about since he was a phenom growing up in British Columbia, Canada.

While he didn’t win that opening faceoff - he didn’t win many, going just 2 for 13 on draws - once the puck was in motion, Bedard was frequently a blur.

He recorded the first shot of his career just over six minutes in on a one-timer with Chicago on the power play. He kept right on pumping pucks at Jarry, his No. 98 constantly in motion. He was unafraid to fling his 5-foot-10, 185-pound frame into tight spaces, be they the front of the net or the corners.

Bedard seemed to surprise Jarry with a shot from the short side early in the second and collected the first point of his career late in the second period when he dropped a backhand pass to Alex Vlasic, who then bulled his way in close for a shot whose rebound ended up on the stick of Donato to bring the Blackhawks within 2-1.

Guttman then tied it just past the midway point of the third period with a laser from the slot and Dickinson put the Blackhawks in front to offer a glimpse of the team Chicago hopes it can become on a regular basis, with Bedard at the center of it all.

“He’s a very mature kid for his age,” Dickinson said. “There’s a ton that’s been put on him. It doesn’t seem to phase him. Doesn’t seem to even hit him.”

481,2023/10/11, 'nhl scores',https://www.espn.com/nhl/recap/_/gameId/401559254,"WASHINGTON -- — Eighteen years running, the Sid and Geno Show is still rolling along and capable of being a hit performance.

Sidney Crosby scored twice on the power play, Evgeni Malkin had a goal and three assists and the Pittsburgh Penguins beat the rival Washington Capitals 4-0 Friday night for their first win of the season.

“When they’re at their best, I think they’re still elite players,” coach Mike Sullivan said. “They just control everything within their power to set themselves up for success and we get the privilege to watch it every day.”

Crosby's first goal came while he was falling in front of the net, and his second was a one-timer off a pass from Malkin, who opened the scoring with a shot past Charlie Lindgren. Offseason acquisition Erik Karlsson made the play to keep the puck in at the blue line to set up Malkin's goal.

At the other end of the ice later in the second period, Tristan Jarry stopped Alex Ovechkin on a breakaway, one of his 19 saves for the shutout.

""He had a zone and a half between him and our player, so it was just getting out, challenging and making sure I was at a good spot, and if he were to deke or shoot I was prepared for it,"" said Jarry, who has stopped 51 of the 54 shots he has faced through two starts. ""It is two games in, so I just want to keep improving every game, making sure I’m getting better in practice, making sure I’m focusing on the details and I think that’s going to help my game throughout the year.”

Malkin also assisted on Reilly Smith's goal in the third that made it 4-0 and gave him a four-point night.

“He was just all over the ice,"" Crosby said of Malkin. “Nights like this where he’s feeling it, he’s going to set up guys or create chances himself. He was just all over the puck.”

The play of their longtime franchise cornerstones, newest addition and No. 1 goaltender helped the Penguins bounce back from a season-opening 4-2 loss to Chicago earlier in the week.

They also spoiled the debut of new Capitals coach Spencer Carbery, behind the bench for Washington's first game of the season. Lindgren, starting because Darcy Kuemper's wife gave birth to the couple's first child, was sharp throughout and wasn't to blame for the four goals he allowed on 35 shots.

“The was great and made a lot of good saves,” center Nicklas Backstrom said. ""We all know what he’s capable of. He’s very calm back there, very cool.”

It's the first time the Capitals have been shut out in 49 season openers.

“Just move on,"" Ovechkin said. ""We didn’t get the results, you know? Boys was ready, but we gonna watch the video and gonna play better the next game.”

Game notes

Clay Stevenson backed up Lindgren for Washington in Kuemper's absence. Aliaksei Protas was sent to Hershey of the American Hockey League to clear the salary cap space for Stevenson, paving the way for 5-foot-7 training camp standout Matthew Phillips to play his first game in a Capitals uniform. ... Former Capitals center Lars Eller got a video tribute and standing ovation in his first game back as a visitor since being traded to Colorado and signing with Pittsburgh on July 1. Eller played six-plus seasons with Washington and scored the Stanley Cup-clinching goal in 2018.

482,2023/10/11, 'orioles',https://www.masnsports.com/orioles-rss/orioles-swept-in-alds-with-7-1-loss-in-game-3,"ARLINGTON, Texas – Rookie Jordan Westburg struck out on three pitches, and the Orioles ran out of comebacks. Out of chances to keep playing. They’re going home, and not to host the decisive game.

A team that wasn’t swept in its last 91 series couldn’t squeeze a win out of the ALDS.



Dean Kremer allowed six runs in 1 2/3 innings, with homers by Corey Seager and Adolis García traveling a combined 863 feet, and the Rangers rolled to a 7-1 win in Game 3 before an announced sellout crowd of 40,861, the largest ever at Globe Life Field.

The 101 wins in the regular season and first division title since 2014 must suffice. The launch out of the rebuild and the promise of many playoff teams in the future.

Players had to deal with the present as they sat in the dugout and watched the Rangers celebrate, then made the painful walk back to their clubhouse. The best record in the league didn’t give them a pass.

Many of the players hung at the railing as if burning the images into their brains for future reference.

""Just soaking it in,"" said Ryan Mountcastle, ""and hopefully that's us next year.""

The clubhouse was silent, players slumped in their chairs, except for the occasional sound of a back slapped during a tight embrace. Manager Brandon Hyde went around the room and hugged every player.

""I appreciate you,"" one Oriole told him.

""I appreciate you,"" Hyde replied.

Hyde will view the season as a success, of course.

“How can I not?” he said. “We were supposed to win 76 games. Won 101, won the American League East. Really proud of our group. They defied all the odds. Nobody gave us a chance. These guys played their butts off for six months. We just didn't play well for these last three, unfortunately. And it's definitely a successful season and these guys are going to be really good going forward.”

Some eyes were moist. Some of the words got lodged in throats.

""It doesn't matter when you lose that last game, it stinks,"" said Kyle Gibson. ""For a team to accomplish what we did, I think it's important for these guys to remember that, sure, came up short. This isn't where we wanted this to end. But the reason it hurts so much, you put seven, eight months of work into it and accomplish a lot of really good things. And will in the future, more on the horizon. And just come up short. But this is a really good group.

""Hyder said something at the end, and everything was right. These guys are going to experience a lot of this coming up, so they've got to remember these experiences, understand how much fun it is, and they'll be back.""

""I loved playing with these guys all year,"" said Ryan O'Hearn. ""A lot of good people in here, and showing up and working with them every day has been a pleasure. It didn't end like we wanted it to, but I appreciate all these guys. And it wasn't for a lack of effort, it wasn't for a lack of being prepared or anything like that. Just the way that it shakes out.""

Asked how much he enjoyed the season, O'Hearn said, ""I had a blast, man. Most fun year of my career, without a doubt.""

That's what made the night so emotional and had O'Hearn fighting to maintain his composure.

""Yeah, for sure,"" he said. ""For sure.""

Kremer allowed seven hits and walked a batter in his shortest start since lasting one-third of an inning on June 24, 2021 against the Blue Jays in Buffalo. He was removed for Tyler Wells tonight after 53 pitches.

""Made a couple mistakes, but even the balls that were just off were still getting hit and landing,"" he said. ""It's a hot team right now, one of the best lineups you're going to face.""

The rotation totaled eight innings, with Grayson Rodriguez also going 1 2/3 in Game 2 and Texas also scoring five runs in the second. The starters allowed 13 runs and 20 hits.

“Something we need to work on as a pitching staff going into spring training next year, making more competitive pitches with two strikes,” Hyde said. “We got hurt a lot on that. The Seager homer, a change-up he pulled. Just tough time putting guys away there.”

The Rangers held a moment of silence before the game for the lives lost in Israel from attacks Hamas launched on towns that border the Gaza Strip. Kremer has dual U.S.-Israeli citizenship and visits extended family members during the offseason.

He insisted on pitching tonight, assuring Hyde without hesitation but also telling the media later how “it's going to be in the back of my head.”

Kremer faced 13 batters and eight reached. A tough finish for a guy who started the two clinching games. An assignment made more difficult because the Rangers offense is relentless.

""I don't know that anybody in this game has ever dealt with what he had to deal with today,"" Gibson said, his voice cracking. ""Yeah, I feel for him. He's got so much on his mind right now. I'm super proud of him. What he did today. You find me another example of somebody who went through what he's gone through the last five days and go out there and do what he did. Really proud of him.""

Seager crushed a changeup with one out in the first inning, the ball traveling 445 feet to right field for his record eighth career postseason home run at Globe Life Field. A closed roof already made the ballpark ear-piercingly loud. Seager’s swing almost punctured a hole through it.

Kremer also allowed back-to-back two-out singles and threw 22 pitches. Hyde said it was “all hands on deck.” He wanted to avoid signaling for one until much later.

Nathaniel Lowe led off the second with a 15-pitch at-bat, fouling off seven in a row before lining to left. Rookie Josh Jung singled on the next pitch from Kremer, Marcus Semien doubled with two outs and Seager was given an intentional walk to load the bases. García fell behind 1-2 and barreled a fastball.

Fans went from booing the intentional walk to erupting over the home run. Their mood shifted. The series did not.

Seager drew his ninth walk in the fourth against Gibson, a Division Series record. And the most in a three-game span in postseason history.

Gibson, bypassed for the start, allowed one run and one hit in three innings. Lowe led off the sixth with a 437-foot homer, increasing the longball distance for the Rangers to 1,300 feet.

Nathan Eovaldi pounded the zone, throwing 41 of 51 pitches for strikes in the first four innings. He allowed one run in seven innings to lower his career postseason ERA to 2.70, throwing 76 of 98 pitches for strikes and receiving a curtain call.

“They pitched really well, and hats off to Eovaldi tonight and some of their other guys,"" Mountcastle said. ""They got timely hits, and it is what it is.”

Gunnar Henderson had a run-scoring single with two outs in the fifth, and his three hits made him 6-for-12 in the playoffs. O’Hearn snapped an 0-for-26 spell with a single in the fourth. But Cedric Mullins went 0-for-12 in the ALDS and was 2-for-48 in his last 14 games with an at-bat.

DL Hall struck out three batters in 1 2/3 scoreless innings. Hyde brought in Yennier Cano to get the last out in the eighth, playing matchups until the end.

Aroldis Chapman loaded the bases in the top of the eighth and pinch-hitter Aaron Hicks ran the count full and bounced out against José Leclerc. The last gasp.

""It feels like we're taking those baby steps,"" Mullins said. ""At the end of the day, expectations for us weren't high. We exceeded them in a big way. So, continue to press forward in that sense and come back next year.""

“I know there’s going to be a lot made of getting swept for the first time in however long,"" Gibson said, ""but I think no matter how you lose, it’s frustrating because you put yourself in a position where we thought, this is a really good team, right? Anything can happen in the playoffs in three games, four games, whatever it is. So, I don’t think there’s anything to the sweep or anything you take extra. No matter how you lose, it hurts. It’s a really good group of guys and I think that adds a little bit of sting to it, too, because we know that we have something special and you want to try to capitalize on that whenever you can.”

The Orioles’ 101 wins tied the 1971 team for fourth-most in franchise history. They lost the World Series in seven games in ’71. This year’s club didn’t reach the Championship Series.

The ’72 Orioles didn’t make the playoffs. Expectations will soar in 2024.

Small consolation after being grounded tonight.

""It's definitely not how you want to end it,"" Henderson said. ""Hate that it ended that way, but there's good that can come out of this. We can use it as fuel for next year. Just don't want to feel this feeling again, so I'm sure everybody's going to have that on their minds going into the offseason and especially into next year.""

""This feeling sucks,"" Kremer said, ""but on the bright side, this is our first taste of the postseason. Pretty much everybody in this clubhouse is coming back, so a lot of good years to look forward to.

“Each of us individually had our own ups and downs throughout the season and just looking for do it again next year.”

""Baseball sometimes does what baseball does,"" Mullins said, ""and just don't come out on top.""

Perhaps it will be the Orioles celebrating again next fall, with another team watching from the dugout.

""We have a lot of guys who have never been to the postseason before, so this hurts, and it's OK to hurt,” Hyde said. “It's OK to have this kind of fuel your fire in the offseason. It's going to take a while for us to get over this a little bit. But I think our guys will come in hunting and hungry in spring training. The guys coming back, especially the young guys, know what this feels like, knowing what it tastes like, and it sucks. If they did soak it in a little bit, they're going to be better for it down the road.”"

FLORIDA — Following the touchdown of two destructive tornadoes in Pinellas and Citrus counties during the early-morning hours Thursday, the National Weather Service is warning residents that there may be more to come. The agency has issued a tornado watch for 28 Florida counties.

A tornado warning for southwestern Pasco County, northwestern Pinellas County and northwestern Hillsborough County was canceled after a water spout was confirmed just offshore near Harbor Bluffs and Clearwater, moving at 40 mph, at 11:35 a.m. ""The storm which prompted the warning has weakened below severe limits and no longer appears to be capable of producing a tornado,"" said the NWS. ""Therefore, the warning will be allowed to expire.""

Nevertheless, a tornado watch remains in effect for west-central Florida through 3 p.m. The NWS said gusty winds are still possible with this thunderstorm. Counties under the watch include: Alachua, Baker, Bradford, Citrus, Clay, Columbia, Dixie, Duval, Flagler, Gilchrist, Hernando, Hillsborough, Lafayette, Lake, Levy, Manatee, Marion, Orange, Pasco, Pinellas, Putnam, Seminole, St. Johns, Sumter, Suwannee, Taylor and Union.

Strong thunderstorms will affect parts of Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties through 12:45 p.m, the National Weather Service said. Just before noon, radar was tracking a cluster of strong thunderstorms near offshore Pinellas County extending northeast and moving northeast at 40 mph. Wind gusts up to 40 mph and possible funnel clouds are a hazard. Communities and locations that could be affected include: Tampa, Clearwater, Largo, Pinellas Park, Temple Terrace, Seminole, Lutz, Holiday, St. Petersburg, Palm Harbor, South Highpoint, Tampa International Airport, Egypt Lake-Leto, Greater Carrollwood, University, Ridgecrest, Bay Pines, Keystone, Greater Northdale, and East Lake.

Framingham native and sports commentator Katie Nolan took the win on “Celebrity Jeopardy!” Wednesday night, beating out actor Christopher Meloni in a tiebreaker.

Nolan, known for shows such as the Emmy-winning “Garbage Time with Katie Nolan,” dominated most of the game, with the highest scores in the Jeopardy, Double Jeopardy, and Triple Jeopardy rounds, with scores of $4,500, $8,900, and $10,300, respectively.

The true test of Nolan’s Jeopardy abilities came during the Final Jeopardy round, where she and Meloni both answered correctly to tie, necessitating a tiebreaker round. Unlike Final Jeopardy where all contestants answer, the first person to buzz in with the correct answer would be the winner.

The category for the tiebreaker round was French History, with the clue being: “Drink up! A famous New Orleans street is named after this dynasty that ruled France for most of the 17th & 18th centuries.”

Nolan buzzed in first, with the correct answer — “What is Bourbon?” — making her the winner of Wednesday’s “Celebrity Jeopardy!” and advancing her to the semifinals.

The other two competitors in Wednesday’s game were actor Meloni, known for “Law & Order: Special Victims Unit,” and Sherri Shepherd, former panelist on “The View” and current host of the daytime talk show “Sherri.”

A “Celebrity Jeopardy!” contestant’s winnings are donated to a charity of their choice. Nolan is playing for the Association of Women in Sports Media, a nonprofit organization supporting women in sports media, both professionals and students.

SoCal winner of $1.7B Powerball jackpot still a mystery, but store owners to get $1M

FRAZIER PARK, Calif. (KABC) -- We now know the latest lottery billionaire bought their ticket in Southern California - the third $1 billion-plus ticket sold in the state in just the last year.

But it could be a while before we know who that lucky winner is.

The ticket for Wednesday's $1.765 billion Powerball jackpot was sold at a liquor store in Kern County.

California Lottery officials on Wednesday noted that the winner has up to a year to come forward to claim the prize. And after that, the lottery's claim process team can take 6 to 8 weeks to review and confirm the winning ticket.

""We won't know who that person is - or maybe it's a group of friends or family members who play together - until they come forward,"" said California Lottery spokesperson Carolyn Becker.

Similarly we also still don't know the identity of the last lottery billionaire - a ticket that was also sold in Southern California.

On July 19 a ticket sold in downtown Los Angeles matched all six numbers and won $1.08 billion.

California Lottery officials confirmed on Wednesday that person has still not stepped forward to claim the prize.

After that drawing, the Powerball reset to $20 million. It was then drawn 35 consecutive times without a winner and once again crossed that billion-dollar threshold, becoming the second-largest jackpot in U.S. history. And while Powerball is played across 45 states, that second big winner was sold only about 100 miles from the summer billion-dollar winner.

The owners of the store that sold the most recent jackpot are entitled to a $1 million bonus - minus federal taxes - from the lottery.

Andy Khalil, who co-owns Midway Market and Liquor with his brother, said he'll use his share of the bonus to help pay for his children's college.

""I want to thank Frazier Park people for supporting a small business such as us,"" Khalil said. ""Also I want to thank the lottery team for the effort and the good service provided for us.""

""I only get half the money,"" he noted. ""The other half goes to my brother. I want to make sure my kids have enough funds for college.""

We do know the identity of one of the other winners from the latest lottery draw: California public schools.

Sales from the latest jackpot, which started in July, racked up some $119.5 million for the state's public schools, including K-12 as well as public colleges and universities.

The winning numbers in the drawing were 22, 24, 40, 52, 64 and the Powerball 10.

RELATED: Lottery officials reveal winner of historic $2B Powerball jackpot who bought ticket in Altadena

California lottery officials on Tuesday revealed the identity of the person who bought a Powerball ticket at an Altadena service station and won a historic $2.04 billion jackpot.

This week's jackpot is the world's second-largest lottery prize after rolling over for 36 consecutive drawings, since the last time someone won the top prize on July 19. That streak trails the record of 41 draws set in 2021 and 2022.

The only top prize that was ever bigger was the $2.04 billion Powerball won by a player in California last November.

The $1.7 billion jackpot is for a sole winner who opts for payment through an annuity, doled out over 30 years. Winners almost always take the cash option, which for Wednesday night's drawing is estimated at $774.1 million.

Besides the jackpot ticket sold in Frazier Park, Atlantic Wine and Spirits in Monterey Park sold a 5/5 ticket. That ticket is worth $760,111.

The Denver Broncos brought in Sean Payton to turn things around, but things haven't gone as planned as the 1-4 Broncos heading into Kansas City to take on the 4-1 Chiefs.

The Chiefs have been far from perfect, but quarterback Patrick Mahomes is just too good, and their defense has played well enough to keep them on top through five weeks of the season. With scattered storms and the possibility of severe weather in the forecast, some outside forces could affect both teams.

WHY IS ARROWHEAD IN KANSAS CITY THE LOUDEST NFL STADIUM?

Kansas City Chiefs-Denver Broncos fantasy implications

When deciding between players whom you equally like, weather can be the ultimate tiebreaker.

With scattered storms and gusty wind in the forecast, the weather is something fantasy owners will need to keep an eye on.

WHY SCIENCE SAYS BRONCOS KICKER BRANDON MCMANUS COULD'VE MADE 64-YARD FIELD GOAL IN DENVER

No matter the weather, Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is a must-start, along with Mahomes. But if rain does impact the game, Chiefs running back Isiah Pacheco, a top-15 fantasy running back this season, will probably be the Chiefs offensive player you want in your lineup.

Unfortunately, for anyone who has Broncos offensive players on their roster, they may be tougher to start unless you have faith in Russell Wilson.

Denver Broncos vs. Kansas City Chiefs could see scattered storms Thursday

A severe weather threat increases on Thursday as a coast-to-coast storm system continues moving across the U.S. The Storm Prediction Center has placed areas of Nebraska, Iowa, Missouri, including Kansas City, and Kansas under a level 2 out of 5 on its thunderstorm risk scale.

WHICH NFL TEAMS DO THE BEST IN THE COLD?

Scattered storms could fire as early as the afternoon in Kansas and continue to spread east through the evening hours.

Kickoff at 7:15 p.m. CDT should be dry but very windy.

There will be thunderstorm chances throughout the game, but the greatest chances for severe weather could be toward the end of the game.

Any severe storm that develops will be capable of producing large hail, damaging wind gusts and flash flooding. A tornado or two also cannot be ruled out."

Both teams could also be up against inclement weather, with significant wind gusts a possibility in Kansas City.

As of Thursday morning, The Weather Channel forecasts partly cloudy conditions around kickoff (8:15 p.m. ET), with chances of precipitation increasing to above 10% only after 11 p.m. But the forecast includes steady winds of between 15-20 miles per hour, and notes that ""there is a marginal risk of severe weather"" throughout the evening.

Meanwhile, the National Weather Service in Kansas City and Pleasant Hill, Missouri, noted Wednesday that several ""strong to severe storms"" were in development overnight into Thursday, with hail and winds up to 40-60 mph possible. Accordingly, AccuWeather projects a potential severe thunderstorm for Thursday night, with wind gusts up to 39 mph.

How might strong winds affect Broncos vs. Chiefs? For one, the passing games could be scaled back to avoid throwing into gusts. And both Denver and Kansas City lean heavily on their respective aerial attacks; Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes ranks sixth among all players in passing attempts this year, while Broncos QB Russell Wilson is tied for second with 11 passing touchdowns.

In the event the AFC West foes are forced to turn to the ground, the Broncos are expected to have reinforcements, with starter Javonte Williams set to return from a quad injury that kept him out in Week 5. The Chiefs have leaned mostly on second-year back Isiah Pacheco, who's scored in three straight games."

Cleveland Browns tight end David Njoku warms up before before an NFL football game against the Baltimore Ravens. LAPRESSE

As the severe burns on David Njoku's face and hands continue to heal, Cleveland's tight end feels fortunate. He knows things could be so much worse.

""I'm still breathing,"" he said. ""I still got my vision and everything, I mentally feel great.""

David Njoku opens up on facial burn accident: my eyes were open Parker Johnson

Njoku spoke Friday for the first time since he sustained burns in an accident at home on Sept. 29, two days before the Browns played Baltimore. Despite his serious injuries and being in extreme pain, Njoku played and had a team-high six catches.

The 27-year-old Njoku was reluctant to offer details about the incident.

""It was a bonfire accident,"" he said. ""Trying to have a nice little chill Friday, ended up exploding when I lit it up. So yeah, it happens.""

Njoku said his eyes were open when he was hit by the fireball.

""So I saw everything and I really should have been blinded,"" he said, sitting in front of his locker. ""So luckily I'm not.""

Njoku said everything happened so quickly, that it was almost impossible for him to process things.

""Shockingly, I'm not trying to sound like a freak, but it was kind of a rush,"" he said. ""Like that adrenaline surge. It was cool, but obviously we have to be smarter and I'm glad that nothing drastic happened.""

Njoku posted photos on Instagram of his injuries, hoping his recovery might help others

""I've been getting a lot of messages from other burn victims and nurses that have burn victims, and they were telling me how everybody feels embarrassed to show whatever,"" he said. ""So I wanted just to come out forth and show myself so everyone feels a little bit better about themselves. End of the day, things heal.""

Njoku's ability to tolerate the pain and play impressed his teammates.

""Says a lot about him,"" said wide receiver Amari Cooper. ""Showed a lot of toughness on his part, 100%. There are a lot of players who definitely would not have played with that happening to them less than 48 hours before the game and for good reason.

""I was actually surprised when he played as well. But it says a lot about his toughness.""

Njoku sounded as if he never considered not playing.

He arrived at Cleveland Browns Stadium for the game against the Ravens wearing a mask to hide his injuries and then wore a mask during warmups. Njoku, a first-round draft pick in 2017 from Miami, left without speaking to reporters afterward.

Although he missed three practices this week, he was on the field Friday and intends to play Sunday against the San Francisco 49ers.

""The way I see it, all the pain and sufferings from training in the offseason is far worse than any of this,"" he said. ""We really push ourselves a lot to strive to be great. So a little burn isn't going to stop me."""
489,2023/10/13, 'austin scott',https://legal-planet.org/2023/10/16/more-on-the-speakers-race/,"Meet Austin Scott — No, sorry, say goodby to Austin Scott

Or as Groucho put it, “hello, I must be going.”

Since I started reporting on the environmental aspects of the House Speaker race, I might as well continue. After I last wrote on Friday, following Scalise’s surprise withdrawal, another candidate tossed his hat in the ring, Austin Scott from Georgia. As an aside, I can’t help but wonder: what is the ring, and why is it a target for airborne headwear? But I digress — though from a topic that is nearly as lightweight: Austin Scott’s four-hour quest for the speakership.

There are certain subatomic particles that last for such a short amount of time that they can be observed only by the particles they release when they decay. So too for Austin Scott, who announced for Speaker on Friday morning, caused the release of eighty votes in his favor later Friday, and vanished before he could even really be interviewed about his candidacy.

I can’t resist another digression. The shortest unit of political time was previously thought to be the scaramucci, equal to its namesake’s ten-day stint as communications director in the Trump White House. Politics watchers will now have to recalibrate and replace the scaramucci with the austinscott, which is less than 2% as long.

Still, it was fun while it lasted.

Scott was actually an interesting candidate. His lifetime LCV score was comparable to Steve Scalise’s, but that’s somewhat misleading. What is interesting about Scott’s scores is that they were extremely low until 2017 but then rose steadily to 17% in 2021, a high score for a House Republican. In 2022, however, like many Republicans, his score was zero.

To be sure, the scores require interpretation. In 2021, Scott’s three scored votes weren’t directly environmental (a hate crimes bill and certifying election results in Pennsylvania and Arizona). In 2020, his pro-environmental votes were for the Great American Outdoors Act and for Great Lakes restoration, and in 2019 he voted to reject an amendment that would have restricted federal protection for endangered whales. Admittedly, this voting record looks good only by comparison to others like Jim Jordan, the Republican caucus’s preferred choice.

Scott didn’t seem to be a climate change denier. In a hearing on an agriculture spending bill, he said that climate has a profound impact on the agriculture industry and natural resources. In another hearing, he said: “Many of the recommendations focus on reducing America’s dependence on fossil fuels and not enough on emissions, in other words, if we could move from diesel to natural gas, that certainly is a benefit to the environment. The focus on emissions would be more productive than the focus on simply eliminating fossil fuels.” Not exactly what we’d want to hear, but again, much better than Jim Jordan.

It appeared for those few brief hours of his political life that in environmental terms, Scott might be better than Kevin McCarthy would have been, and he would have definitely been an improvement over Jordan. And Scott had the additional benefit of being willing to uphold the results of democratic elections. That, alas, may have torpedoed his chances.

By the time this post goes live, I have no idea if Jordan will still be a candidate, but I’m tired of rewriting these things every few hours. If Jordan goes down, I suppose he’ll be replaced by Marjorie Taylor Greene of “Jewish space laser” fame. (Fact Check: She didn’t actually use the phrase “Jewish space laser” but she did suggest that the Rothschilds, Jerry Brown, and PG&E were responsible for starting deadly California wildfires with a beam of light from space.) I wouldn’t have the heart to post about her anyway. So I’m going to go ahead and post this Monday morning, come whatever may."

Mr Drennan (21), of Mountrath, Co Laois, was standing at a bus stop on the Dublin Road in Castletroy on Friday night when a car that had been involved in a collision with another car earlier that night struck and killed him.

It is understood that Mr Drennan, who was shortlisted for Journalist of the Year at the annual national Student Media Awards, was waiting for a bus around 9.50pm, after he had finished a shift at a local restaurant.

[ Five men die on Ireland’s roads over the weekend ]

Gardaí said the driver of one of the cars “failed to remain at the scene” and that the driver of the second car, a male in his 40s and a woman adult passenger, were taken to University Hospital Limerick for non life threatening injuries.

Paying tribute to Mr Drennan on Sunday, Dr Kathryn Hayes, Course Director of the BA Journalism and Digital Communication course at University of Limerick said: “We are absolutely devastated in the journalism department and in the wider UL community to learn of the tragic death of our student Joe Drennan. Our heartfelt sympathies are with Joe’s family at this terrible time and all of his classmates and many dear friends.”

Ms Hayes said Mr Drennan had been “an inspirational student and a hugely talented young journalist, who had a bright career ahead”.

“He was passionate and creative and will be sorely missed by all of us who had the pleasure of knowing and working with him,” Ms Hayes added.

In a letter emailed to staff and students, the President of University of Limerick, Professor Kirstin Mey, wrote: “Dear Staff and Students, I am so deeply sad to inform you of the passing of a valued member of our University of Limerick community Joe Drennan, fourth year BA in Journalism & Digital Communication. Joe was also the Editor-in-Chief of the Limerick Voice newspaper.”

“We hold Joe’s family in our thoughts especially his parents Tim and Marguerite and his brothers John, Richard and Kieran and sisters Eva, Sarah and Marie. Our sympathies go out to all of Joe’s journalism classmates and lecturers, to his housemates, friends and fellow UL students and the many others who will be so devastated by his loss.”

“Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.”

Gardaí have appealed for witnesses to contact them and are understood to be investigating whether there are any possible links between the fatal collision and a burnt out vehicle discovered in Corbally, Friday night.

The car that struck Mr Drennan was allegedly involved in an interaction with a Garda unit before the collision on the night, and therefore, while Gardaí are continuing their own investigation, they have also referred the circumstances surrounding the fatal collision to the office of the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission (GSOC)."

A Kylian Mbappe brace powered France to a 2-1 win over Netherlands which booked their place at Euro 2024.

It took France's captain just seven minutes to score as he hooked in a pinpoint Jonathan Clauss cross.

The Dutch rallied before the break and could have gone into it level, but Joey Veerman squandered their best opportunity and Xavi Simons was denied by a fine Mike Maignan save.

Eight minutes after the restart, Mbappe played a one-two before he magnificently curled a bouncing ball over the goalkeeper and into the Dutch net, from outside the box.

The spirited Netherlands pulled a late goal back through impressive debutant Quilindschy Hartman, who started a move with a nutmeg and finished it by fooling the goalkeeper and slotting home at the near post when Maignan was expecting a cross.

Mbappe hit the bar late on as his search for a hat-trick came up short, just like the Dutch search for an equaliser.

France have a perfect six wins from six and cannot finish outside of the top two in Group B. The Netherlands are third in the group, three points behind Greece - after their 2-0 win over the Republic of Ireland - who they play in Athens on Monday.

Talking point - Even with injuries, France remain tough nut to crack

Hartman's goal was the first France have conceded in European Championship qualifying. No other country had maintained an unblemished defensive record this long into the campaign.

It's a feat which is all the more impressive when you consider some of the defenders France are missing, and that this was the second game in a row where Didier Deschamps experimented with Lucas Hernandez at centre-back, with brother Theo to his left. You imagine he would not like to do that against better opposition, but so far it has worked and comes from a genuine injury crisis. Dayot Upamecano, Axel Disasi, Presnel Kimpembe, Wesley Fofana and William Saliba were among the central defenders unavailable.

Tournament football is tense and winning teams are more often than not built on a solid defensive foundation. France kept four clean sheets at the 2018 World Cup they won, for example, and just one in 2022, when Mbappe's final hat-trick was in vain.

There will undoubtedly be a step up in intensity and quality if France go deep into Euro 2024, but for now the signs are encouraging.

Player of the match - Kylian Mbappe (France)

While the first goal owed much to Clauss' cross, the second was all about Mbappe. Despite all of France's star power, Mbappe is a cut above and showed that in Amsterdam.

GOAL! NETHERLANDS 0-1 FRANCE (MBAPPE) 7' - Clauss makes good ground on the French right, moves the ball on but in time gets it back and crosses for Mbappe, who acrobatically hooks the ball into the net.

BIG CHANCE! 27' - Dumfries, Simons and Reijnders combine down the right and the former holds off two defenders to cut the ball back to Veerman - 12 yards out and with the goal gaping - but he shoots over.

GOAL! NETHERLANDS 0-2 FRANCE (MBAPPE) 53' - Mbappe doubles the lead with a brilliant goal! He plays a one-two with Rabiot and upon collecting the return pass, still outside the box, Mbappe curls a dipping shot over Verbruggen and into the net.

GOAL! NETHERLANDS 1-2 FRANCE (HARTMAN) 83' - Hartman starts the move with a nutmeg, plays a one-two with Bergwijn, bursts into the box and fools Maignan, slotting in at the near post when the goalkeeper was expecting a cross.

OFF THE BAR! 86' - Mbappe makes space to shoot on the edge of the box and hits a swerving shot which fools Verbruggen and comes back off the bar.

It was fourth-and-3 on the Denver Broncos’ opening drive Thursday night; the ball was at the Kansas City Chiefs’ 38-yard line. Finally defeating Patrick Mahomes, especially at Arrowhead Stadium, was going to require Denver to frequently land big-play punches on offense, and this was a chance to draw first blood.

“We had a really good drive going, and we thought we could get something on the left side. It was there for a second,” Wilson said.

But Wilson came off the read and moved to his right. The problem: There were no routes designed to follow him along his preferred escape route. Unable to turn a corner on the outside, he was sacked by Justin Reid. Just like that, the Broncos had blown one of their few legitimate scoring opportunities in a 19-8 loss. It was Denver’s 16th straight loss to its superior AFC West rival.

On the second play of Denver’s next drive, after the Broncos defense limited the Chiefs to a field goal, Wilson dropped back to pass and saw Jerry Jeudy up the left seam. Wilson said he saw Chiefs linebacker Nick Bolton too and planned to throw the ball over him. But the pass came out flat, and a leaping Bolton picked it off.

“Unacceptable,” Wilson said. “Can’t happen.”

Broncos head coach Sean Payton said he was “disappointed but not discouraged” following the loss. He pointed to a team that played hard on short rest. He noted that an embattled defense turned in its best performance of the season, particularly stingy in the red zone against Mahomes and the Chiefs’ dynamic attack. He said there are things the Broncos can build on before a home game against the Green Bay Packers in 10 days and a rematch with the Chiefs in Denver after that.

“We played an imperfect game,” Payton said, “but I thought we had great effort and energy tonight.”

Selecao captain Ronaldo placed his spot kick past Martin Dubravka after Denis Vavro had handled inside the visitors' penalty area in the 28th minute, then slotted in from former Manchester United teammate Bruno Fernandes' cross to help his side secure their place in Germany next summer.

Goncalo Ramos headed in Fernandes' 18th-minute delivery for the opener as Portugal dominated the first half, but David Hancko's opportunistic effort from outside the box was deflected past Diogo Costa via Antonio Silva's heel as Slovakia became the first team to score against Portugal during the campaign.

In torrential conditions, Stanislav Lobotka's exquisite long-range strike again reduced the deficit to a goal on a night when Portugal required a win to qualify because third-placed Luxembourg earned a point in Iceland.

Dubravka kept out Rafael Leao's early header and two late attempts by substitute Diogo Jota among the succession of stops, and Portugal needed Fernandes' ingenuity – he has now contributed five assists and two goals in his last three qualifers.

Slovakia did not trouble Diogo Costa until the second half, although they will take encouragement from their achievement of becoming the first team of the last nine Portugal have faced to score against them.

Portugal are next in action when they visit Bosnia and Herzegovina on Monday before travelling to Liechtenstein on November 16 and hosting Iceland in their final qualifier three days later.

Slovakia are two points above Luxembourg, who they play away on Monday before hosting Iceland and heading to Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Ronaldo eyes more Euro records

Five-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo will be 39 when the Euro begins in June, and the tournament is likely to extend his own outright record of appearances at the finals to six, having been ever-present since 2004.

The 25 Euro finals games the Al Nassr forward has played in is already six more than any other player, and his 14 goals are five more than next-nearest Michel Platini, with France's Antoine Griezmann (seven) the only other active player on the leaderboard.

He is the only player to have scored three or more goals at multiple Euro tournaments and has now scored 52 goals at the finals and in qualifying combined. The next-nearest player in that respect is Zlatan Ibrahimovic, on 25.

This was not quite the procession it looked like being before Hancko struck for Slovakia, who had tested Portugal when they lost 1-0 in Bratislava earlier in qualifying and showed commendable tenacity to persevere in Porto.

What an assist by Bruno Fernandes for the opener against Slovakia! 🪄🇵🇹#EURO2024 | @ManUtd pic.twitter.com/cFSM6EHBZJ — Viaplay Sports UK (@ViaplaySportsUK) October 13, 2023

With Ronaldo exhibiting a cartoonish sense of fun that was missing from his 2022 World Cup displays, though, Roberto Martinez's side never seemed in genuine danger of dropping points, especially with Fernandes' laser-guided accuracy.

The ability to bring the likes of Liverpool's Jota and Atletico Madrid's Joao Felix off the bench shows the squad depth Martinez can call upon, with the likes of new Manchester City midfielder Matheus Nunes not even called up.

Martinez had cause to sound more genuine than most international managers when he spoke of selection dilemmas during the week, and the 2016 champions are undoubtedly contenders for the title again this time.

The main note of concern was the worsening downpour at the Estadio do Dragao, making flowing football difficult as large puddles formed on the pitch. The conditions seemed to suit Slovakia, who could not find an unlikely equaliser to postpone the celebrations Portugal embarked upon at full-time.

Portugal vs Slovakia live updates, highlights, commentary

FULL-TIME: Portugal qualify for Euro 2024!

The Selecao hold off Slovakia's late comeback in dire conditions to reach Uefa Euro 2024!

It wasn't quite as serene as their campaign had been until tonight, but Cristiano Ronaldo's two goals have helped his side secure their spot at the finals in Germany next summer.

Slovakia remain in a strong position to qualify in second, third-placed Luxembourg having drawn 1-1 in Iceland.

88 mins: Portugal 3-2 Slovakia

Bruno Fernandes curls in a vicious, inviting free-kick from the right. No Portugal recipient can meet it effectively at the far post.

85 mins: Portugal 3-2 Slovakia

Goncalo Ramos, Bernardo Silva and Joao Palhinha make way for Diogo Jota, Ruben Neves and Otavio.

82 mins: Portugal 3-2 Slovakia

Slovakia have now achieved what no team could manage in eight Portugal qualifying games, scoring against the Selecao – and doing so twice with Stanislav Lobotka's tremendous finish.

80 mins: GOAL – Portugal 3-2 Slovakia (Stanislav Lobotka)

That will very likely be the pick of the goals tonight! Stanislav Lobotka fires a sensational strike beyond Diogo Costa from well outside the penalty area.

Can Slovakia level during the remaining 10 minutes or so? That will certainly give them momentum.

78 mins: Portugal 3-1 Slovakia

Substitute Joao Felix sends an effort wide. Slovakia are low on time to reduce the deficit again.

75 mins: Portugal 3-1 Slovakia

Martin Dubravka pushes Bruno Fernandes' strike behind. Without wishing to persistently talk about the weather, that save is made more impressive by the perilous goalkeeping conditions.

72 mins: GOAL – Portugal 3-1 Slovakia (Cristiano Ronaldo)

Goal number 125!

It was remiss not to point out that Joao Cancelo went on a scintillating run through the centre before skying a shot over the crossbar just before Slovakia scored.

This time the defender whips in a low cross from the right, straight onto the boot of Ronaldo at the far post to slot in.

A VAR check takes place to the sound of jeers. It's given!

71 mins: Portugal 2-1 Slovakia

A reminder: Portugal will need to win to go through tonight if Luxembourg, who are currently drawing 1-1 in Iceland, don't lose.

69 mins: GOAL – Portugal 2-1 Slovakia (David Hancko)

Portugal's flawless defensive record in qualifying is over!

David Hancko tries a low shot from distance, which seems advisable on the slippery turf. It hits Antonio Silva on an ankle inside the penalty area, wrong-footing Diogo Costa and arrowing in!

66 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Cristiano Ronaldo produces that gritted smile after performing a plethora of stepovers while trying to befuddle a marker inside the penalty area to no avail.

63 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

No let-up for Slovakia if they were hoping to have fewer threats to deal with: Joao Felix replaces Rafael Leao. The Milan attacker evidently isn't perturbed by the downpour, because he doesn't look best pleased about coming off.

60 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Few chances to speak of, with Slovakia - who've now had their first two attempts of the game in this half, the second of which required a reasonably routine save from Diogo Costa - improving a little.

It's far from accommodating weather for flowing football.

57 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Portugal manager Roberto Martinez is a hardy man. Where some people would probably have donned a jacket approximately half an hour ago, the coach has only just reverted to putting his on.

Perhaps it's all those winters he spent sampling the English weather.

54 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Could the weather become an issue here? The ball is holding up a bit on the turf. It's torrential. Portugal will be desperate for no interruptions with a place in the finals tantalisingly close.

51 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

If Slovakia can't reply, it'll be nine successive qualifying matches without conceding a goal for Portugal – extending their own best ever run in that regard.

No signs of that changing during this second half, but the weather is – the rain is getting even heavier.

48 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Those Slovakia changes haven't had the required effect. Denis Vavro, who conceded the penalty from which Cristiano Ronaldo scored Portugal's second, lofts the danger away in front of his own goal as the hosts threaten again.

46 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Slovakia, who need to find momentum, make two changes at the break: Laszlo Benes and Tomas Suslov replace Juraj Kucka and Robert Mak.

Halftime: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

There's time for one last Portugal attempt, Cristiano Ronaldo lifting an overhead kick from a cross over the target, then sticking out his tongue and smiling.

Ronaldo's reaction sums up his side's half. They've been utterly dominant and deservedly lead 2-0. A place in the finals beckons unless Slovakia can summon something extraordinary.

Gonçalo Ramos 👉



🇵🇹 7 goals in 9 games for Portugal ⚽️#EURO2024 pic.twitter.com/4NsgPD3AcC — UEFA EURO 2024 (@EURO2024) October 13, 2023

45 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

There will be one minute of added time. Slovakia will probably be pleased to discover that.

43 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Goncalo Ramos hits the post! Cristiano Ronaldo canters forward, performs a stepover inside the penalty area and blasts in a low cross-shot, which reaches his fellow scorer in an onside position at the far post, which is exactly what his effort connects with as he reaches out a leg. Unlucky!

41 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

At the risk of making this sound like the Cristiano Ronaldo show, the main man would clearly like it to meet that description.

He sees a fierce shot blocked behind, then grins and gees up the crowd with both arms as the rain thuds down in Porto.

39 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Cristiano Ronaldo should have had a second! Bernardo Silva clumps in a fierce shot that Martin Dubravka can only parry into the striker's path, but it comes at him too quickly for the five-time Ballon d'Or winner to adjust his feet, ricocheting off his lower leg and bobbling just wide of the open goal.

37 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

More generosity from Slovakia allows Goncalo Ramos to stab a low shot towards goal. Martin Dubravka gathers.

35 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Slovakia have toiled to create anything telling in attack tonight, and they struggle again when presented with a free-kick near the Portugal penalty area on the left, the opportunity quietly fizzling out.

32 mins: Portugal 2-0 Slovakia

Exhibition play from Portugal, Ronaldo, Bernardo Silva and Joao Cancelo all combining skilfully on the right.

The flow of attempts has eased up but they're clearly enjoying themselves.

29 mins: GOAL – Portugal 2-0 Slovakia (Cristiano Ronaldo)

International goal number 124 for Cristiano Ronaldo! The Portugal captain rolls his penalty past Martin Dubravka and slinks off to celebrate.

Portugal are hurtling towards qualification!

28 mins: Portugal 1-0 Slovakia

Penalty to Portugal! Denis Vavro is adjudged to have handled a Rafael Leao cross in a transgression that didn't appear to be in any way contentious.

Inevitably, Cristiano Ronaldo steps up...

25 mins: Portugal 1-0 Slovakia

Martin Dubravka might feel he should have stopped that goal, but now he produces a superb save to keep Bruno Fernandes' close-range free header out with one hand!

Portugal have had all of the early chances. They're threatening to run away with this.

23 mins: Portugal 1-0 Slovakia

Bernardo Silva drills a first-time shot from outside the penalty area down into the turf and comfortably wide. The Manchester City magician was reacting after Slovakia partially cleared a corner into his path.

20 mins: Portugal 1-0 Slovakia

Portugal haven't conceded a goal in this qualifying campaign. This will be some achievement if Slovakia can salvage a point or three.

18 mins: GOAL – Portugal 1-0 Slovakia (Goncalo Ramos)

Portugal are on course for the finals!

Bruno Fernandes wedges a deft cross towards the centre of the penalty area, where Goncalo Ramos rises unmarked to steer a header beyond Martin Dubravka.

That's seven goals in nine Portugal appearances for the scorer!

16 mins: Portugal 0-0 Slovakia

Slovakia hit the post! Antonio Silva can only apply a wayward touch to a cross from the left in front of his own goal, and Diogo Costa touches the deflection on to the woodwork with a reflex stop.

End-to-end entertainment. Portugal look a little rattled for the first time!

14 mins: Portugal 0-0 Slovakia

Two fines saves in quick succession from Martin Dubravka!

The Slovakia goalkeeper initially keeps out Bruno Fernandes' shot from distance. Portugal's ensuing attack ends with Rafael Leao planting a firm header towards goal, only for Dubravka to deny him expertly.

11 mins: Portugal 0-0 Slovakia

Bruno Fernandes tries to locate Cristiano Ronaldo at the far post with a long, angled cross from the left towards his former Manchester United team-mate.

Martin Dubravka advances and claims.

8 mins: Portugal 0-0 Slovakia

Portugal look certain to score amid chaos in front of the Slovakia goal! Ronaldo tries a backheel which is cleared off the line, then Bernardo Silva almost converts from approximately two millimetres out.

It's offside, though.

6 mins: Portugal 0-0 Slovakia

Portugal win successive corners. First, Cristiano Ronaldo picks up possession after some Slovakia slackness, firing in a thunderous diagonal shot from outside the penalty area that takes a deflection and goes wide of the far post.

Then a brilliant piece of trickery from Joao Cancelo on the right allows him to burst between two players, only for Slovakia to see the danger away at the expense of another set-piece.

4 mins: Portugal 0-0 Slovakia

Not much to report during the early stages. Neither side has had a meaningful attack yet, while Portugal have had more of the ball, as you'd expect.

2 mins: Portugal 0-0 Slovakia

Portugal ping passes around at the back during the opening two minutes. Joao Cancelo shows some nifty control to keep the ball in by one of the corner flags nearest his goal as Slovakia try to apply pressure.

1 mins to KO: The referees are in a fetching neon light green tonight. Portugal pose for a photo. Then captains Milan Skriniar and Cristiano Ronaldo exchange pennants.

2 mins to KO: The anthems are being recited! Portugal boss Roberto Martinez is looking sharp in a suit tonight.

15 mins to KO: Stat attack: Portugal have lost one of their last 27 Euro qualifying matches at home, winning 20 of them.

They've also won four and drawn one of their previous five matches against Slovakia.

35 mins to KO: Slovakia have won four of their last five games, the exception being that defeat to Portugal. Want an example of the danger they pose? We can oblige.

40 mins to KO: A reminder of the permutations: Portugal will qualify if they win, or if they draw and Luxembourg lose in Iceland.

There are potential consequences elsewhere because of the result here, too: Bosnia and Herzegovina will be unable to finish in the top two if Slovakia win and they lose – and Iceland face that same scenario.

""They played very well and worked well without the ball, with aggression,"" Martinez said. ""In the second half, we were better. What we will see on Friday is a very well-crafted Slovakia. Our players know this and have already shown that when the opponents play well, they also know how to win.

“We are focused and want to be at our best to try to win the game. There are no easy games and that is very clear.

""We have won six games because the players had an exceptional attitude and commitment. We know that, individually, we have players at a different level than other teams – but that doesn't mean the games are easy.""

1 hour 40 mins to KO: Slovakia have kept six clean sheets in their last nine European Qualifiers, so they should be well placed to provide resistance against one of the form teams of the campaign this evening.

""We always want to play so that we don't focus on the opponents,"" manager Francesco Calzona said in the build-up. ""We have our game principles – we always want to stick to them.

The hosts have won their last eight Euro qualifying matches without conceding a goal – their longest winning sequence in qualifying history. But Slovakia's only defeat in their last nine qualifiers was their 1-0 defeat to Portugal during the current campaign, and the visitors can give their own hopes of reaching Germany a huge boost with a positive result.

Known as the ""ring of fire"" thanks to shape of circular light created by the partial eclipse, the event is expected to occur this Saturday, Oct. 14, and travel from the coast of Oregon to the Texas Gulf Coast, according to NASA.

The distinct annular eclipse is different from a total eclipse, the next of which is expected to occur in April, and will be the last opportunity for people in the states to catch a glimpse of a ring of fire for a number of years.

Residents of nine states can hope to get a look if the weather is clear, though it is suggested that anyone staring up the sky take proper safety precautions before doing so in order to protect their eyes.

Here's what to know about when, where and how to view this unique celestial event.

October 2023 solar eclipse forecast:Will clouds ruin the view?

When is the 'ring of fire' solar eclipse?

The solar eclipse will begin on Saturday and, weather permitting, first become visible in Oregon around 9:13 a.m. PDT and end in Texas around 12:03 p.m. CDT, according to NASA.

It will then move beyond the U.S. and over Mexico, Central America and finally South America before ending around sunset off of Natal, Brazil in the Atlantic Ocean.

Unfortunately for celestial enthusiasts in the Eastern time zone, the annular eclipse will only be visible in portions of the Pacific, Mountain and Central Zones and is the last of its kind that will be viewable in the U.S. until 2039.

Solar eclipse viewing map:'Ring of fire' solar eclipse is coming to US in October. Here's when (and where) you can see it.

Where can you view the solar eclipse?

The fiery eclipse will be viewable in a handful of U.S. states, including:

Oregon

Nevada

Utah

New Mexico

Texas

California

Idaho

Colorado

Arizona

Here are some projected key times:

9:16 a.m. PDT: Eclipse should first become visible near Eugene, Oregon

9:19 a.m. PDT: Alturas, California

9:21 a.m. PDT: Battle Mountain, Nevada

10:26 a.m. MDT: Richfield, Utah

10:34 a.m. MDT: Albuquerque

11:52 a.m. CDT: San Antonio

After, it will leave the U.S. to pass over Guatemala, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama. It will then move over South America in Colombia before ending off the coast of Northern Brazil.

How to watch an eclipse safely:How to safely watch the solar eclipse: You'll want eclipse glasses or a viewer Saturday

What is the 'ring of fire'?

In general, a solar eclipse is what occurs when the moon passes between the sun and Earth, casting a shadow that blocks the sun's light, says NASA.

Whereas a total solar eclipse happens when the moon completely blocks the face of the sun and a partial eclipse occurs when the sun, moon and Earth do not perfectly line up and create only a partial cover, an annular eclipse is a little more distinct.

Occurring when the moon is at its furthest point from the Earth, an annular eclipse means the sun is not fully covered. Instead, the moon being farther away makes it appear smaller, so when it passes between the sun and Earth it creates the appearance of a smaller disk positioned in front of a larger one.

The smaller, dark moon juxtaposed against the bigger, bright sun creates what looks like a bright ring around the moon as the sun peaks around the edges. This visual effect is where the name ""ring of fire"" comes from.

Solar eclipses:A spectacular solar eclipse will darken the sky Saturday. Will the one in April be better?

Phases of the annular eclipse

There are multiple phases to an annular eclipse.

First, it begins with the partial phase when the moon begins moving across the sun. It will progressively block more of the sun's light, eventually forming a smaller crescent shape.

About an hour and 20 minutes after this, the annularity phase begins and the moon passes fully in front of the sun, creating the ""ring"" which lasts about one to five minutes.

The moon will then pass across the sun's face for the next hour and 20 minutes, once again creating a partial eclipse until the moon completely moves past the sun."

(Oct. 14, 2023) – The U.S. Men’s National Team fell 3-1 against Germany in the first of two international matches this month. Team captain Christian Pulisic scored an incredible goal on a brilliant solo run before Germany rallied in front of a record sellout crowd of 37,743 at Pratt & Whitney Stadium at Rentschler Field.

The U.S. wasted no time setting the tone as Pulisic finished off a ball over the top from McKennie in the third minute before being waived offside by a narrow margin. The USA showed defensive composure on the other end as the back line and goalkeeper Matt Turner shut down dangerous chances, all the while not shying away from attacking as Gio Reyna, Tim Weah and Pulisic led the charge pushing into the offensive third.

The Americans opened the scoring in style in the 27th minute as Balogun laid off the ball for Pulisic just past midfield. From there, the USA captain exploded on the dribble toward goal and avoided an enclosing circle of five defenders before he fired off a curling strike from 20 yards out to score a stunner in the upper right corner.

Germany then responded in the 39th minute as midfielder Leroy Sane showed off solo skills of his own, dribbling out of trouble and laying off a pass away from Turner for midfielder Ikay Gündogan, who finished with a tap-in from five yards out.

The second half started with a warning from the visitors as Turner came up with a big save to deny Gündogan from the top of the box; however, Germany then converted in quick succession. The first came in the 58th minute as Gosens did well to set up forward Niclas Füllkrug with a pass into the box which he finished with a low shot. Then in the 61st minute, an unfortunate deflection for the Americans off a defensive tackle set up Füllkrug for a pass to Musiala as he crashed into the box for a sliding finish.



Sparked by the use of all six available substitutes, the USA continued to press in the attack and came close to scoring a few times, including efforts from midfielder Yunus Musah off a corner that sailed just over the bar as well as a dangerous effort from forward Ricardo Pepi that caused trouble inside the Germany box but was ultimately cleared out of danger.

NEXT UP: The USA will close out the October window as it takes on Ghana on Tuesday, Oct. 17 at GEODIS Park in Nashville, Tenn. (8:30 p.m. ET; TNT, Universo Max, Peacock, Futbol de Primera Radio).

GOAL SCORING RUNDOWN:

USA – Christian Pulisic (Folarin Balogun), 27th minute: Balogun laid off the ball for Pulisic about 10 yards past midfield, where he explosively dribbled toward goal, avoiding an enclosing circle of five defenders, and fired a curling strike from 20 yards out to score a stunner on the upper right corner. USA 1, GER 0

GER – Ikai Gündogan (Leroy Sane), 39th minute: Sane received a long ball on the right side and did well to dribble toward the center, showing nice footwork to get out of trouble and laying off a pass for Gündogan to tap in from five yards out. USA 1, GER 1

GER – Niclas Füllkrug (Robin Gosens), 58th minute: As Germany built up in the attack, Gosens received a ball in the air near the edge of the box from the right side. From there, he settled with a one-touch pass to find Füllkrug inside the box near the penalty spot to slot home low past Turner. USA 1, GER 2

GER – Jamal Musiala (Niclas Füllkrug) 61st minute: On an individual effort in which Musiala ran around the left side and tried to dribble into the box centrally, a deflection off a defending tackle sent the ball to Füllkrug on the left, where he squared a low pass back to Musiala as he crashed into the box for a sliding finish into the back of the net. USA 1, GER 3 FINAL.

Saturday's slate featured four ranked vs. ranked matchups and the biggest showdown of the day did not disappoint. No. 7 Washington held on to beat No. 8 Oregon in an offensive thriller as the game-tying kick in the final seconds sailed wide right. Michael Penix Jr. got the better of Bo Nix in the Heisman duel, throwing four touchdowns to Nix's two in the win.

After a chalky start to the day, things livened up a bit in the evening. USC's Caleb Williams threw three interceptions in a blowout loss on the road at No. 21 Notre Dame. No. 14 Louisville fell from the unbeaten ranks after its own big win over the Irish a week ago. Jimbo Fisher's seat may be getting a lot hotter after another road loss in a winnable game against No. 19 Tennessee.

Deion Sanders had an uneasy feeling, even up 29-0 at halftime. Maybe not the worst collapse in Colorado history about to unfold uneasy, but uneasy anyway.

Stanford coach Troy Taylor didn't really change a thing, but just watched as the Cardinal steadily staged the largest comeback in school history.

In a late-night thriller — the game started on Friday the 13th and finished on Saturday the 14th — this is a game that will be etched in the history of both programs.

Joshua Karty connected on a 31-yard field goal in the second overtime after tying the game in regulation, Elic Ayomanor had a school-record 294 yards receiving and Stanford rallied for a 46-43 victory over Colorado early Saturday.

Not so for the Buffaloes, who were reeling from the largest blown lead in school history. The old mark was 28, set at Kansas on Nov. 6, 2010.

Sanders sensed something was amiss, too. Just a little bit of complacency creeping in.

""I talked to them about the old cliche people say — it's 0-0 but that's not true. It's not 0-0, it's 29-nothing,"" the Colorado coach said. ""I felt complacency going into the half because we stalled offensively, gave up some yardage as well. Just didn't like how I felt going in at halftime. We come back out and here comes complacency. Here comes that team that I can't stand, that you can't stand it. You can't understand how in the world that happens to us. But it did.""

Stanford safety Alaka'i Gilman picked off a floating Shedeur Sanders pass in the end zone to set the stage in the second OT for Karty, who also drilled a 46-yarder with no time left in regulation.

""That was a dumb play,"" Shedeur Sanders said of his errant throw. ""I just threw it up.""

The Cardinal (2-4, 1-3 Pac-12) trailed big at halftime, with QBs Justin Lamson and Ashton Daniels unable to light a spark.

That is, until the second half when Daniels — with Lamson contributing — led Stanford on eight straight scoring drives. The Cardinal had 408 of their 523 yards in the second half and OT.

Daniels threw for 396 yards and four TDs. Ayomanor had 13 catches — all after halftime — and three TDs, including one to tie up the first overtime — a remarkable catch at that — and another for 97 yards that changed the game. His 294 yards receiving broke the school record held by Troy Walters (278) against UCLA in 1999.

Ayomanor and the Cardinal left the sell-out crowd stunned.

""Just knowing that as a team you all persevered until the end,"" Ayomanor said, ""and kept fighting is a lot more satisfying than silencing the opposing team's crowd.""

Colorado committed 17 penalties for 127 yards in a game that started at 8:20 p.m. local time and ended at 12:21 a.m. Coach Sanders was still trying to wrap his mind about what happened at his post-game news conference.

Could Deion Sanders, Colorado see their season go sideways?

""From youth on, I don't remember being up 29-0 and losing a football game,"" Sanders said. ""I really don't. This is a little tough for me.""

Shedeur Sanders finished with 400 yards passing and five touchdowns and rushed for a team-leading 37 yards. He and the Buffaloes (4-3, 1-3) were clicking early, amassing a huge lead. It looked over.

It wasn't.

""We have no choice but to go forward. That's life,"" Deion Sanders said. ""We didn't expect that. ... We can't sit down and have no pity party.""

Two-way standout Travis Hunter returned after missing three games following a late hit in the Colorado State game that sent him to the hospital with a lacerated liver. He had 13 catches for 140 yards and two scores. He also had five tackles.

""The plays he made kept us in the game,"" Sanders said.

Leading into the game, Deion Sanders said on his weekly radio show that late kickoff games are the ""stupidest thing ever invented."" This was the second late one for the Buffaloes this season that's gone to double OT at Folsom Field. The first one went their way, with the Buffaloes rallying to beat Colorado State 43-35.

This time, it was Stanford that rallied.

""Right now, we're not built for the moment,"" Sanders said. ""Some of our players aren't built for the moment where they have to make a play.""

BY THE NUMBERS

29-0: The rally from 29 points down was the largest comeback in Stanford history, and was also the largest blown lead in Colorado history.

4: It was the fourth-largest overall comeback in Pac-12 history.

The top three:

34: UCLA vs. Texas A&M in 2017

32: UCLA vs. Washington State in 2019

30: California vs. Oregon in 1993.

294: Stanford's Elic Ayomanor set Stanford's single-game receiving record with 294 yards, breaking the mark set by Troy Walters (278 receiving yards vs UCLA) in 1999.

80+: This is Colorado's fourth game with 80-plus penalty yards, the most in FBS.

The takeaway

Stanford: The Cardinal snapped a seven-game conference skid.

Colorado: Defense continues to be an issue. The Buffaloes are allowing nearly 36 points a game.

Up next

Stanford: The Cardinal host No. 18 UCLA on Oct. 21.

Colorado: The Buffaloes have a bye week before traveling to UCLA to face the Bruins on Oct. 28.

499,2023/10/14, 'pakistan vs india',https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/12/india/india-pakistan-cricket-world-cup-intl-hnk-dst-spt/index.html,"New Delhi and Islamabad CNN —

In October 1952, five years after the Indian subcontinent won independence from its British colonial rulers, a young Pakistan cricket team stepped foot in the newly formed Republic of India.

They had arrived to play a highly anticipated test series – the first for Pakistan after the country’s creation in 1947.

For many of the players, the drive from Lahore in the Muslim-majority nation of Pakistan, to Amritsar in Hindu-majority India, brought back painful memories of a bloody partition – one that hastily divided the former colony along religious lines with devastating results and gave rise to a fierce geopolitical rivalry.

In the 76 years since, India and Pakistan have fought three wars and introduced heavy restrictions on exchanges of goods or civilians, despite the two countries sharing a border, a culture and a deeply intertwined history.

And among that shared culture is a near universal love of cricket.

Pakistan has not toured India since 2016. But on Saturday, for the first time in seven years, these two rivals will play each other on Indian soil in the opening stages of Cricket World Cup, which India is hosting.

That game, said Farees Shah, host of the Shiny Side Cricket Podcast, could have “easily half a billion people” watching.

“This is five times the Super Bowl,” he said. “There are few rivalries that compare.”

Often described as one of the greatest sporting grudge matches in the world, an India-Pakistan cricket match is always bound up in the geopolitical faultlines that separate the two nations.

Yet the game, a legacy of British colonial rule, has also shown it has the ability to be something bigger, something greater than making runs and taking wickets.

It has the ability to unite – not divide – the more than 1.6 billion people who live spread across the subcontinent.

As Pakistan’s cricket team arrived in India’s southern city of Hyderabad last month, they were met with rapturous applause from Indians waiting at the airport for the star players. Then when Pakistan created World Cup history this week, pulling off the highest successful run chase against Sri Lanka, Indians in the stands cheered with joy and excitement.

And when Pakistan’s cricket captain, Babar Azam, gifted his country’s jersey to a ground worker at one of the stadiums, it was hailed by an Indian newspaper as a “terrific gesture.”

Speaking to reporters before the World Cup began last month, Azam spoke of his excitement at being in the country.

“I think the way people are responding towards our team, it is not like we are in India,” he said with a smile. “It is like we are home.”

Unable to travel

Yet, while camaraderie has played out on the pitch, conspicuously missing in the stands are Pakistani fans, for whom it is incredibly difficult to travel into India due to red tape and historical mistrust that restricts the movement of citizens between the countries.

Even the Pakistan cricket team were only able to obtain visas at the eleventh hour, after complaints of a delay in the process which the Pakistan Cricket Board said disrupted the team’s preparation for the event.

CNN has contacted India’s Sports Ministry and the Home Ministry but is yet to receive a response.

Abdul Jalil, a mascot for Pakistan’s cricket team known as Chacha Cricket (Uncle Cricket) said he has been attending matches for 54 years and had wanted to visit India for this one too but did not know how to go about applying for a visa.

“The Indian government hasn’t given any process on how to give a visa, no idea on how to get a visa. There’s no explanation for visas,” he said.

“I want to make it my mission to spread peace,” he added. “I have fans in all of the main Indian cities where people ask me to stay in their homes. I am a guest of Hindus, Sikhs and Muslims. If you spread love then you will get love.”

Hadeel Obaid, the founder of KheloKricket, a platform seeking to develop, promote and celebrate cricket at a grassroots level, said she had been to previous World Cups and would “love” to go to India for this game too.

“There’s something electric in the air. It doesn’t matter who you support as a cricket fan, you can appreciate good cricket,” she said.

“But one of the major reasons I didn’t apply is because I didn’t think I would get permits to go. The whole process seemed a little daunting.”

Even so, she said the respect the two teams have for each other “is pretty incredible.” She added: “The messaging that is out there is impactful, despite the political atmosphere.”

Fans in India have responded with similar excitement.

Avro Mukerji from Gurgaon, a city just outside capital New Delhi, said the game has “a special significance” for him as he has been avidly following this rivalry since 1992, when the Pakistan team, led by cricket legend turned former prime minister Imran Khan, clinched World Cup victory.

“There are few memorable moments across the years which as a fan will cherish forever,” he said.

“Ajay Jadeja thrashing Waqar Younis, Venkatesh Prasad getting the better of Amir Sohail after a verbal spat, Sachin’s performance in a run chase against Pakistan… it’s a mix of excitement and nervous energy for the fans.”

For Divya Bakhshi Bhatnagar, also from Gurgaon, the game is “more than just a match.”

She added: “An India/Pakistan match is about the country uniting for a sport. It actually reinforces our identity as Indians, where religion, politics, and economy don’t matter and don’t define us. It’s solely the sport and the spirit of winning ‘together’.”

Tensions simmer

Much of the tension between India and Pakistan is linked to a decades-long conflict in Kashmir – a vast, largely mountainous region between the two nuclear-armed nations, that both claim in its entirety.

The region has been bitterly contested by India and Pakistan since partition and New Delhi accuses Islamabad of supporting militant groups there. The festering issue has spurred three wars between the countries.

In more recent years games have taken place on neutral ground, in a third country such as Sri Lanka or the UAE, to prevent tensions between fans from simmering over.

“I think the turning point was 2004, when India toured Pakistan and beat them convincingly,” said Vaibhav Vats, a New Delhi based cricket writer.

“That’s when the confidence and self-image of both teams began undergoing a shift. That shift is part of contrasting national trajectories: India sees itself as a rising power in the world, while in Pakistan the feeling is of stagnation and decline.”

Since Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) rose to power nearly a decade ago, India has has grown increasingly important on the world stage. It has been repeatedly courted by Western leaders, who see the nation as a key partner in the Indo-Pacific region.

India overtook China to become the most populous country earlier this year, with its 1.4 billion strong – and largely young – population seen as an avenue for further growth and innovation.

Pakistan has, by contrast, had a more troubled decade, plagued by political instability, militants attacks and, more recently economic chaos and deadly floods, upending the lives of tens of thousands in the country of 230 million.

Yet, as India grows on the world stage, Modi and his BJP have come under increasing scrutiny for what rights groups say is a crackdown on minorities – in particular some 170 million Muslims – in the world’s largest democracy.

“This game will be taking place in a significantly charged climate,” said Vats, citing what he said was increased religious intolerance during Modi’s rule.

And in a move that isn’t without irony, the Pakistani cricket team play against India on Saturday at the world’s largest cricket stadium – named after Prime Minister Modi – in his home state of Gujarat.

“That this is happening in what is now the world’s largest stadium… it’s symbolic of a new India,” said podcast host Shah. “Pakistan playing there is India showing its power.”

CNN has reached out to the BJP but is yet to receive a response.

Half a billion viewers

This makes Saturday’s match one of the most anticipated of the year.

TV screens will be lit up in homes across both countries, in remote villages and in coffee shops, restaurants and clubs, as millions tune in for the game.

While India and Pakistan have, over the decades, worked hard to shed the image of a subject of their erstwhile colonial rulers, one thing is clear: the game of cricket is no longer viewed as a gentleman’s sport inherited from the British.

The national teams of both countries are viewed as symbols of the future – of a modern and vibrant subcontinent that appears to be moving forward.

“The World Cup is the one with the history and the legacy, it’s the one you want to win,” Shah said.

Vats, the New Delhi journalist, said the political situation “does not affect” the teams.

“They get along extremely well,” he said. “There is no hostility in the dressing rooms.”"

After six ugly rounds featuring nearly as many clinches as landed punches, Fury took a controversial majority decision victory to remain undefeated in the boxing ring.

Fury's decision win seemed unlikely to many observers after he was deducted a point in the second round for blows behind the head. In a six-round fight, the loss of a point is a massive blow to a fighter's chances, but two of the three judges saw Fury as having done enough to get the victory despite the setback.

Round after round, the fighters were warned for excessive clinching. Despite the warnings, both men fell into clinching every time they were at distance. That smothered any punches from either man, leaving very few moments where either man truly made their mark in any round.



""Listen, a lot went on in the buildup,"" Fury said of his performance after the fight. ""I couldn't use my right hand for six weeks. I'm not an excuse maker, but I couldn't use my right hand. ... Listen, I fought my heart out. I fought my absolute heart out and that's all I can do. I said there'd never be another Tyson Fury. I'm just trying to be the best Tommy Fury I can be.""

KSI took issue with the scorecards and the two men briefly argued in the ring with KSI telling Fury that Fury was supposed to be the boxer while KSI was ""the YouTuber."" Fury responded by calling KSI a sore loser.

While many believed a fight with Jake Paul was the prize for the winner, Fury shot down the idea, saying he was done with the ""crossover bulls---.""

Fury defeated Paul by split decision in February, suffering a late knockdown. With two straight narrow wins over ""crossover"" boxers, Fury may need to think long and hard about whether he wants to go back to trying to truly climb the professional ranks.

In the co-headliner, Logan Paul beat Dillon Danis over six rounds, but it's how the fight ended that will have people talking. Danis, an MMA fighter by trade, attempted a double-leg takedown, which Paul stuffed. With Danis on the ground, Paul threw a punch that landed on Danis, who got up angry as the referee tried to call time. Danis then went after Paul as security flooded the ring to keep the peace. In the end, Danis was disqualified for his actions. He also landed a total of nine punches over the course of six rounds, leading to a large disparity on the judges' scorecards that became meaningless after the DQ verdict.

Alongside a photo of herself and Hamel, 87, she wrote, ""As you know, I had breast cancer two decades ago, and every now and then it pops up again, and I continue to bat it down. I have used the best alternative and conventional treatments to combat it. This is not new territory for me. I know how to put on my battle gear and I’m a fighter.""

In the same post, the actress also expressed gratitude for how much Hamel — and her entire family — have supported her.

""Alan has been by my side every step of the way,” she continued. “I can’t even explain how much he has done for me. If it’s even possible, we are even closer than ever. My incredible family has been so supportive, and have helped so much by keeping the business running so you can still have access to all the wonderful products. Thank you for the continued love and support. It’s only about who you love and who loves you - and I love you!""

502,2023/10/15, '49ers vs browns',https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401547476,"CLEVELAND -- — From dominant to defeated — in less than a week. The San Francisco 49ers were reminded there are no perfect teams or givens in the NFL.

Brock Purdy suffered his first loss as a starter and the Niners had their regular-season winning streak stopped at 15 when rookie kicker Jake Moody missed a 41-yard field goal with six seconds remaining, giving the Cleveland Browns an unexpected 19-17 win on Sunday.

“I don’t think we deserved to win,"" said 49ers star defensive end Nick Bosa. ""We didn’t underestimate them, but they did play better than us. We haven’t lost in a long time in the regular season, so it hurts a lot more.”

Dustin Hopkins kicked four field goals for the Browns (3-2) — the last with 1:40 left, capping a drive helped by a disputed unnecessary roughness call against San Francisco. Cleveland pulled off the upset without quarterback Deshaun Watson, who missed his second straight game with a bruised right shoulder.

The 49ers (5-1) came in looking nearly unbeatable after destroying Dallas 42-10 at home last week and scoring at least 30 points in each of their first five games.

But Cleveland’s top-ranked defense was more than up to the task, and the 49ers were short-handed in the second half without playmakers Christian McCaffrey and Deebo Samuel, who both went out with injuries.

P.J. Walker came off Cleveland's practice squad and outplayed Purdy, who threw his first interception this season, finished with just 125 yards and nearly pulled off a stirring comeback in the final moments before Moody's failed kick.

The 23-year-old Purdy had been perfect in his pro career, winning his first 10 regular-season starts and coming in with the highest passer rating (121.1) in league history for any quarteback through 10 games.

But the Browns kept him off balance and he completed just 12 of 27 passes (44%) — well below his league-leading average (72.1%) coming in.

“I didn’t play at the standard that I needed to,” Purdy said. ""We feel like we failed our own expectations. I just have to be better and make the throws. Man, it’s the NFL. When you get opportunities, you’ve got to take care of them. There are plays that we didn’t make.”

Despite being without McCaffrey and Samuel, Purdy made a couple big throws on San Francisco's final drive and positioned the ball in the middle of the field for Moody, who pushed his attempt to the right.

“It’s on me,” said Moody, who missed a 54-yard in the first half. ""I’ve got to make these kicks in these situations. That’s what I signed up for at my position. The team fought really hard to give me a chance.

""It was a perfect snap, perfect hold. I just didn’t hit it the way I wanted to.”

When the ball sailed into the net, Cleveland's sideline erupted in celebration and Browns fans danced in the aisles after seeing the home team finally catch a few breaks.

'""The truth is, we’re a good football team,"" Browns coach Kevin Stefanski said. “We’re not perfect, we know that. But we fought like crazy, and I’m just proud of so many guys.”

The 49ers were heavy favorites at the start of the week, and their odds only grew when the Browns ruled out Watson on Friday.

They turned to Walker, who was only signed in August, and the 28-year-old showed poise on Cleveland’s final drive — and got away with a questionable throw into the end zone — to set up Hopkins for the winner.

The Browns were also helped with a roughness call on 49ers safety Tashaun Gipson Sr., who spent four seasons with Cleveland. On 3rd-and-10, Walker's throw for Elijah Moore was high but Gipson was called for the personal foul for leading with his helmet.

“My view was his intent wasn't at all to do that,” 49ers coach Kyle Shanahan said. “It looked like the receiver was coming in there, jumping, too. It looked like they touched helmets from where I was. It didn't look that violent.”

Purdy was out of sync most of the afternoon, and things got even tougher for the second-year QB when Samuel went out with a shoulder injury and McCaffrey couldn’t push through an oblique issue.

On the road for the first time in four weeks, the 49ers began mixing it up with the Browns about 30 minutes before the opening kick.

Tempers flared during warmups with a brief skirmish on the 49ers sideline. There was a lot of trash talk and San Francisco left tackle Trent Williams shoved Moore from the side and knocked his helmet off.

Helped by two personal fouls against the Browns, the 49ers scored on their first possession with Purdy shoveling a short pass to McCaffrey, who made two quick cuts got to the outside and went in untouched.

SCORING STREAK

McCaffrey’s touchdown extended his streak of scoring to 15 straight games, two shy of the NFL record held by Hall of Famer Lenny Moore.

McCaffrey is tied with John Riggins and O.J. Simpson for second place.

INJURIES

49ers: Samuel spent an extended period in the medical tent before going to the locker room. He spent the second half on the sideline in street clothes. ... McCaffrey tried twice to come back in before being ruled out. Coach

Browns: LB Anthony Walker sustained a concussion and didn’t play in the second half.

Monday night delivers a mouthwatering matchup between two teams desperately in need of a win to catch up to their division leaders. The Dallas Cowboys-Los Angeles Chargers showdown should deliver plenty of explosive moments both on offense and defense.





The Dallas defense began the season in style by shutting out the Giants, while the offense went and dropped 40 points to raise the curtain on what appeared to be a promising start to 2023. But in recent weeks, the Cowboys have struggled to wrangle opposing offenses. To the shock of many, they lost by to the Arizona Cardinals, then in Week 5 (in prime time again) they hit their nadir as they got blown away by the San Francisco 49ers. So will Dallas stop the slide, or will lightning strike twice in prime time?





The Bolts are coming off two straight wins and a bye week as they hope to light up SoFi Stadium with a big win over one of the top teams in the NFC. Justin Herbert is off to an impressive start and should be buoyed by the return of Austin Ekeler from an ankle injury. This is also somewhat of a revenge game, with offensive coordinator Chargers offensive coordinator Kellen Moore facing off against his old team.





Here are four things to watch for when the Cowboys visit the Chargers on Monday night:

505,2023/10/15, 'patriots vs raiders',https://www.espn.com/nfl/recap/_/gameId/401547474,"LAS VEGAS -- — Hanging over a game in which several ex-New England Patriots played key roles in a victory against their former team was the loss of Las Vegas Raiders quarterback Jimmy Garoppolo to a back injury.

Raiders coach Josh McDaniels didn't have an update on Garoppolo after Las Vegas' 21-17 win Sunday, and the availability of the oft-injured quarterback could be a major issue going forward.

Brian Hoyer played the entire second half against the Patriots, throwing for 102 yards, but whether he would be the answer going forward remains to be seen.

The Raiders also could turn to rookie Aidan O'Connell if Garoppolo is out.

“I think there are a lot of balls up in the air right now relative to Jimmy,” McDaniels said. “We'll have a little patience and see what the report is going to be. I'm hoping for the best, obviously. We'll find out more and try to make the best decision for the team.”

Garoppolo played the first half before being ruled out with a back injury. He completed 14 of 22 passes for 162 yards with a touchdown and interception.

Then he gave way to Hoyer.

“It’s my 15th year,” Hoyer said. “I’ve pretty much seen all the situations, and really what it comes down to is playing football regardless of the situation.”

The Raiders have won back-to-back games to move to .500 at 3-3 and ended a six-game streak going back to last season of not scoring at least 20 points. This was the Raiders’ 500th regular-season victory as a franchise, 10th best all time.

Patriots coach Bill Belichick remains at 299 career regular-season wins, losing to McDaniels, his former longtime offensive coordinator. This is the first time Belichick, whose first season in New England was in 2000, has started a season 1-5 with the Patriots.

“Couldn’t quite make enough plays here tonight,"" Belichick said. ""Had our opportunities and just need to do a better job here and really just about every area. Any one of the number of things could have made a difference. We just need to coach it better, play it better, execute it a little bit better. That’s really the story again.”

McDaniels was one of many former Patriots who had a major role in this victory. Garoppolo and Hoyer played under McDaniels in New England, and Jakobi Meyers — who had five receptions for 61 yards — spent the previous four seasons there.

“As a guy who was with those guys, I know there is a lot of talent on that team,"" Meyers said. “Those guys can play football. They've had a bunch of change on the team over the last couple of years, so they're working on some things.”

Josh Jacobs rushed for 77 yards for the Raiders, and rookie tight end Michael Mayer caught five passes for 75 yards. Mayer had three catches for 41 yards entering the game.

Patriots quarterback Mac Jones was 24 of 33 for 200 yards with an interception. New England had just 259 total yards.

The Patriots (1-5) have lost three games in a row. They ended a 79-point scoring streak by their opponents and a 10-quarter drought without a touchdown.

Las Vegas took a 10-0 lead early in the second quarter when Garoppolo completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to Meyers. The Raiders extended the lead to 13-3 at halftime.

New England reached the end zone about midway through the third quarter on 2-yard run by Ezekiel Elliott, who scored on a direct snap and cut Las Vegas' lead to 13-10.

But Carlson made field goals from 30 and 24 yards to give the Raiders a two-possession lead in the fourth quarter at 19-10.

The Raiders needed those points when Rhamondre Stevenson, who is from Las Vegas, scored on a 1-yard touchdown with 3:33 remaining in the game. The drive lasted 9:30, covering 75 yards on 17 plays.

Las Vegas ended any doubts with Maxx Crosby and Bilal Nichols combined on a sack for a safety with 1:47 left.

“Credit the fight of our team,"" McDaniels said. ""That certainly wasn’t a Picasso out there.”

HITTING MILESTONES

Las Vegas' Jacobs reached 5,000 rushing yards with a 7-yard run in the second quarter. He is the fourth Raiders player to hit that number.

Carlson made his 150th field goal with a 37-yarder with 10 seconds left in the first half. Only five other NFL kickers have reached that mark in their first 84 games.

Buffalo Bills running back Damien Harris is resting at home and “seems to be in good spirits” after being released from hospital, Bills head coach Sean McDermott said on Monday.

The 26-year-old was transported off the field in an ambulance after sustaining a neck injury in the second quarter of the team’s home game against the New York Giants on Sunday.

He was injured on his first carry of the game when he was tackled by Giants linebacker Bobby Okereke on a 1-yard run. He remained down after the play, before players from both teams signaled for athletic trainers and doctors.

With players and coaches surrounding Harris, an ambulance was brought out to the field as he was placed to a backboard and a stretcher. He gave a thumbs up as he was being loaded into the ambulance.

The team announced during the game that Harris had been ruled out with a neck sprain and had been taken to hospital for further testing.

McDermott provided a further update on Harris’ health during his press conference on Monday, the day after his team had beaten the Giants 14-9.

“He’s doing well, or as well as can be expected,” said McDermott, who added that Harris was in the concussion protocol.

Harris is in his first season with the Bills after signing with the team in free agency following four years with the New England Patriots.

One of the people anxiously looking on was Bills backup safety Damar Hamlin, who suffered cardiac arrest on the field against the Cincinnati Bengals in early January.

Hamlin collapsed after making a tackle and taking a hit to the chest area. Medical professionals performed CPR on Hamlin when he lost his pulse and he needed to be revived through resuscitation and defibrillation. He was on a ventilator for days and spent more than a week in a Cincinnati hospital.

It was later determined that Hamlin’s cardiac arrest was caused by commotio cordis, which can occur when severe trauma to the chest disrupts the heart’s electrical charge and causes dangerous fibrillations (or abnormal heartbeats).

Hamlin was fully cleared to resume football activities in April and by August, the 25-year-old was a full participant in preseason games. He made the roster for the regular season, but has played only one game this season.

Hamlin didn’t suit up Sunday, but was on the bench where TV cameras showed him with his head down."

In a statement to PEOPLE, the actor reflected on the years of friendship, as well as how he’ll remember his leading lady from Step by Step.

“As with everyone who knew her, I was stunned yesterday by the news that my dear and deep friend Suzanne had passed,” began Duffy, 74. “For that brief moment it was unbelievable. But indeed she has passed. She beautifully passed through my life on this leg of her endless journey. My task now is to remain on the roadside as she continues on.”

He outlined some of the things he’ll miss most when remembering Somers, including “the phone calls, the emails, the visits, and the meals and laughter.”

He continued, “But the dialogue of deep and thoughtful, and silly and frivolous continues. My conversations with her now will be held solely through my daily Buddhist practice.”

Duffy added, “I am not alone in wishing I had one more face-to-face with her and [her husband] Alan, but had we had that meeting last Friday I would still be yearning for just one more today. It is the painful beauty of our present human reality. What strength and support I can muster I send to Alan and [her son] Bruce and her family and to her I say; When the stone of your life dropped in this pond you made quite a ripple my friend. Thank you.”

Somers and Duffy met while costarring as parents of a blended family on ABC's Step by Step from 1991 to 1998.

Year later, in 2021, the Dallas alum said he considered Somers his “best friend.”

“She's a mother above all else. She's a caretaker,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “She's just one of the best people. She's a go-to person. If I ever needed something, I know I could pick up the phone and say, 'Suzanne, I really need help on this.' It would be there.""

X

The stock market rally had a mixed week but had a disappointing finish. The major indexes rose initially but hit resistance, with the Nasdaq leading losses Friday. Meanwhile, market breadth was weak. The Russell 2000 reversed lower toward 2023 lows. Tech leaders started strong, but backed off, sometimes violently.

All of this was an expectation breaker for the market rally. Investors should be cautious about new buys with the market rally struggling and earnings season picking up steam. Selling some recent buys may be warranted.

Tesla (TSLA) is set to report its worst earnings in two years, but TSLA stock has held up as bulls look to future possible growth drivers.

Lam Research (LRCX) and ASML (ASML) kick off results for chip-equipment makers, with huge customer Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM) also reporting. ASML stock is struggling, but LRCX stock and fellow chip-gear giants Applied Materials (AMAT), KLA Corp. (KLAC) are setting up.

Oil-services giant SLB (SLB) kicks off energy earnings with energy stocks showing renewed strength. SLB stock is close to an early entry.

In addition to Tesla stock, Lam Research, Applied Materials, KLA and SLB, investors should also watch tech leaders Arista Networks (ANET), Adobe (ADBE) and Nvidia (NVDA).

Nvidia stock, Tesla and Arista Networks are on IBD Leaderboard. Nvidia, Adobe and Tesla stock are on the IBD 50. ADBE stock, Tesla, Nvidia and SLB are on the IBD Big Cap 20.

Stock Market Rally Expectation Breaker

The stock market rally started the week strong, extending gains from the Nasdaq's Oct. 6 follow-through day, helped by tumbling Treasury yields. But the major indexes stalled out amid whipsaw Treasury moves, while underlying market action was weaker.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.8% in last week's stock market trading. The S&P 500 index advanced 0.45%. The Nasdaq composite fell 0.2%, thanks to Friday's 1.2% retreat.

The Nasdaq cleared the 21-day and later the 50-day line, but fell back below those key levels by the end of the week. The S&P 500 also finished below its 21-day average. The Dow Jones hit resistance at the 200-day line multiple times.

The Russell 2000, which tried to retake its fast-falling 21-day line, reversed for a 1.5% weekly loss, ending at a five-month closing low.

The Invesco S&P 500 Equal Weight ETF (RSP) rose 0.2%, but fell back from the 21-day line as well.

Leading tech stocks made bullish moves, but then fell back. Some energy and pharma stocks did well. Insurers continue to do well, along with select other financials.

The 10-year Treasury yield tumbled more than 15 basis points to 4.63%, but with some big daily swings. Notably, the U.S. dollar extended its long weekly winning streak.

U.S. crude oil futures jumped 5.9% to $87.69 a barrel for the week. Friday's 5.8% spike was the biggest one-day gain in six months. Gasoline futures popped 3.3% for the week and 4.6% on Friday. Israel-Hamas fighting triggered gains over the week, with tougher U.S. sanctions vs. Russian crude helping to spur Friday's advance.

Overall, the stock market rally had an expectation breaker. At Wednesday's close, with the Nasdaq above the 50-day line and leading stocks showing positive action in a confirmed uptrend, the expectation was for further gains. Instead, the market saw significant losses late in the week.

One positive: The CBOE Volatility Index, a market fear gauge, jumped Friday, nearly topping a recent five-month high. Fear levels hitting new highs raise the odds of a bounce.

Friday's overall action in stocks, crude oil and the VIX may reflect concerns about a looming Israeli ground offensive in Gaza, and the potential for wider Mideast conflict.

ETFs

Among growth ETFs, the Innovator IBD 50 ETF (FFTY) fell 0.5% last week. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) edged up 0.2%, but came well off highs. The VanEck Vectors Semiconductor ETF (SMH) finished essentially flat after Friday's 2.5% slide. Nvidia and TSM stock are huge SMH holdings, with LRCX, ASML, AMAT and KLAC also big component.

Reflecting more-speculative story stocks, ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK) slumped 3.7% last week to a five-month closing low. and ARK Genomics ETF (ARKG) sold off 4.4% to the lowest since the March 2020 Covid low. Tesla stock is the No. 1 holding across Ark Invest's ETFs.

SPDR S&P Metals & Mining ETF (XME) fell 0.7% last week. The Energy Select SPDR ETF (XLE) jumped 4.5% and the Health Care Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLV) inched up 0.1%, slashing gains. The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) gained 1%, but also off highs.

The Financial Select SPDR ETF (XLF) climbed 0.5% and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (KRE) fell 1.6%.

Five Best Chinese Stocks To Watch Now

Tesla Earnings

Tesla earnings are due Wednesday night. Analysts have been cutting third-quarter forecasts all year, with further cuts since the EV giant's weak Q3 deliveries. Wall Street currently expects earnings per share to tumble 30% to 73 cents, which would be the lowest EPS in two years. Revenue should rise 10% vs. a year earlier, but slip vs. Q2. Gross profit margins are expected to fall further amid ongoing price cuts.

But the focus will be on the Tesla earnings call. Investors will want positive signals on gross margins, especially with price cuts continuing in October. They'll also want to know more about the Cybertruck, including a launch date and much more. They'll also want any hints about other potential growth drivers.

After shrugging off a stream of bad news, Tesla stock fell 3.6% to 251.12 last week, testing the 50-day line Friday. Shares have a 278.98 cup-with-handle base. Investors could use the Oct. 10 high of 268.94 as an early entry.

TSLA stock fell 1% early Monday, signaling a move below the 50-day.

Ten Most Shorted Stocks Include 3 Tesla Rivals, But Not TSLA

Chip Earnings

ASML earnings are due early Wednesday. Analysts expect the Dutch semiconductor-equipment giant to report a 1% EPS decline with a 7% revenue rise.

Lam Research earnings are set for Wednesday night. EPS should tumble 41% with revenue down 30.5%.

Taiwan Semiconductor earnings are on tap early Thursday. The foundry giant, which makes chips for Nvidia, Apple and many others, is seen reporting a 35% EPS drop with revenue off 14.5%. Taiwan Semi's guidance and capital spending plans will key for the sector, especially chip-equipment makers.

ASML stock edged up 0.4% last week, trying to break a three-month slide but still below key levels. TSM rose 1.3% to 90.46 last week, reclaiming the 50-day and 200-day lines Thursday but falling below levels on Friday.

LRCX stock rose popped 2.7% to 645.12, but fell back below the 50-day line on Friday. Lam Research has a 711.91 buy point from a double-bottom base. Investors could use a move above Thursday's high of 655 as an aggressive entry, with a trendline entry around 685.

Meanwhile, Applied Materials and KLA stock don't report this coming week, but both are building the right side of bases.

SLB Earnings

SLB, formerly known as Schlumberger, reports Friday morning. Analysts see SLB earnings up 22% with revenue climbing 17.5%. Both would mark the second quarter of slowing growth as comparisons get tougher.

SLB's results and guidance will be important for the energy sector, especially for the services firms, drillers and machinery plays that have been leading.

SLB stock jumped 5.8% to 58.96 this past week, retaking the 50-day line Friday. A trendline, currently around 60.50, would offer an early entry in an emerging flat base.

Stocks To Watch

Other stocks to watch including Nvidia, Arista Networks and Adobe.

Nvidia stock edged down 0.7% to 454.61 last week, slumping 3.2% on Friday. The AI chip giant has a 502.66 buy point from a cup base. Early in the week, NVDA stock arguably flashed an aggressive entry. At this point, investors should to focus on the traditional entry, or see if Nvidia stock can forge a handle. The relative strength line, which tracks a stock's performance vs. the S&P 500, has been hitting new highs on a weekly chart.

A significant retreat for Nvidia stock would be a bad sign for the market rally.

ADBE stock jumped 4.2% to 548.76 for the week, briefly clearing a flat-base buy point of 570.24. The entry is still actionable, though a brief cause could be constructive. The RS line is at highs.

ANET stock fell 2.15% to 189.85, but found support at its 50-day line. Shares aren't far from a 198.70 buy point from a flat base, according to MarketSmith. It's part of a base-on-base pattern. The RS line is near highs.

Time The Market With IBD's ETF Market Strategy

What To Do Now

It's still a stock market rally, but there are worrisome signs. It needs to hold its ground and, soon, make some progress.

The Nasdaq and the S&P 500 need to decisively clear the 50-day line, with breadth improving. That would likely coincide with a slew of new buying opportunities. So investors should have their watchlists ready. Focus on stocks showing relative strength.

But if the market shows further deterioration, investors should be looking to scale back. Some promising stocks fell sharply late in the week, already triggering sell signals.

So stay engaged and remain flexible.

When the NFL first released the 2023 schedule back in May, many people immediately circled the Week 6 primetime matchup between the Giants and Bills as one to watch. Of course, this will be the first trip back to Buffalo for head coach Brian Daboll, general manager Joe Schoen and many other members of the team. Daboll served as the offensive coordinator for the Bills from 2018-21, while Schoen was Buffalo's assistant general manager from 2017-21.

""Look, it's the next game,"" Daboll said Monday about returning to Buffalo. ""Been in this league a long time, played against a lot of different teams that I've worked for or players that I've coached. Tremendous amount of respect for the Buffalo Bills organization, (Bills Owner/CEO/President) Terry Pegula, (Bills General Manager) Brandon Beane, (Bills Head Coach) Sean McDermott, all their coaches and players. But our focus is always on us, first and foremost, getting ready to play a game. They're a really good team. So, we'll have our work cut out for us.""

The connections with the Bills run deeper than the two top decision-makers. The other Giants coaches who previously worked in Buffalo include director of coaching operations Laura Young (2015-21), inside linebackers coach John Egorugwu (2017-20), offensive line coach Bobby Johnson (2010-11, 2019-21) and quarterbacks coach Shea Tierney (2018-21). Additionally, quarterback Tyrod Taylor (2015-17), wide receiver Isaiah Hodgins (2020-22), running back Matt Breida (2021), cornerback Nick McCloud (2021) and outside linebacker Boogie Basham (2021-22) all previously called Buffalo home, as well.

""It's an electric environment,"" the head coach said about playing in Orchard Park. ""They'll be going all day, getting ready for the game. It's loud. It's an unbelievable atmosphere. It's hard to hear. Been on the other side of it, too, when I was with the Patriots, the Dolphins and the Jets. And they have a fantastic team. You know they are one of the only two teams that are top five in points on offense and defense, the other team being San Francisco, so they are a great team, and their fans will be ready, they are loud. It's a loud environment.""

5. Scouting the Bills

Despite picking up their second loss of the season in Week 5, the Bills have been one of the most well-rounded teams in the league this year. Their offense enters this matchup ranking third in points and fourth in yards, and the biggest reason for those rankings has been the performance of Josh Allen. The sixth-year quarterback leads the NFL with his 73.1 completion percentage to go with 1,407 passing yards, 11 touchdowns and five interceptions, good for a passer rating of 105.6. Allen has also continued to be a force on the ground, adding 120 rushing yards on 20 carries (6.0 avg.) and three additional scores. Allen has lead the Bills' offense to an average of 35.8 points per game over their last four outings.

""Josh Allen is an unbelievable player, one of the best in the league,"" Daboll told reporters. ""You can put him in probably any offense and he's going to produce. You know, I missed him as a person, we are close, but as a player, he's a heck of a player. Put on any tape, he's exceptional at everything. He can run, but he can throw it and he can throw it wherever he needs to throw it, 80 yards down the field, drop a dime, on the move to the right put it back across his body, scramble, back up, scramble around, throw it out, throw it on time...

""He's a special player. He's one of the best in the league. And he makes you better as a playcaller, too, so he's one of a kind.""

Allen has a clear-cut favorite target in the form of Stefon Diggs. The two-time All-Pro wide receiver ranks third in the NFL in receptions (39), sixth in receiving yards (520) and is tied for the league-lead in receiving touchdowns (five). The 29-year-old has topped 100 receiving yards in four of five games this year, and has racked up four touchdowns in the last two games alone. His 39 receptions are 21 more than anyone else on the team.

Gabe Davis is second on the team with 18 receptions for 320 yards and four touchdowns, and has found the end zone in each of the last four games. Buffalo has two talented tight ends in Dawson Knox and rookie Dalton Kincaid, but both are currently dealing with injuries.

James Cook has recorded the most rushing attempts on the team with 61, which he has taken for 292 yards and a touchdown. Cook has also caught 14 passes for another 140 yards. However, the Bills like to use multiple backs as both Latavius Murray and Damien Harris have combined for 41 carries for 176 yards (4.3 avg.) and three touchdowns.

Despite all of the injuries, the Bills still sport the league's No. 5 scoring defense. Buffalo has a league-high with 21 sacks through five games. Defensive end Leonard Floyd leads the way with 5.5, while defensive tackle Ed Oliver is right behind him with four. Defensive ends A.J. Epenesa and Gregory Rousseau have also registered three sacks apiece.

Sean McDermott's defense has also racked up an NFL-leading 13 turnovers, including eight interceptions. Milano, linebacker Terrel Bernard and safety Micah Hyde have picked off two passes each, while cornerback Taron Johnson has forced two fumbles."

Cortez was a Mexican-American broadcaster and activist who pioneered Spanish-language media in the United States by founding the first full-time Spanish language radio and television stations in the country, Google notes.

The design was illustrated by Mexican American artist Rafael Lopez and depicts the various roles Cortez played in Latino culture and civil rights in the U.S.

He was born in Veracruz, Mexico in 1905 and his family eventually immigrated to San Antonio, Texas. He entered the media scene in San Antonio as a reporter for ""La Prensa,"" a San Antonio-based, Spanish-language daily newspaper.

He later began buying airtime on KMAC radio producing Spanish songs, comedic acts and sketches. Cortez applied for his own radio station and went live on-air in 1946 with the first Spanish-language radio station in America, with the slogan ""La Voz Mexicana.""

The success of his radio show led to Cortez adding television to his broadcasting operation, becoming the first Latino-run American TV station in Spanish.

In addition to his contributions to media, Cortez was also a civil rights advocate for Latinos in the U.S. throughout his life. He oversaw the court case Delgado v. Bastrop Independent School District, which ended the segregation of Mexican Americans in Texas public schools.

The National Association of Broadcasters awarded Cortez the media excellence award, and the trade publication Radio Ink created an award − Medallas de Cortez Hispanic Radio Award − to celebrate Latino radio leaders, in his honor. He died in 1971 in San Antonio.

Cortez and his media programs were included in the American Enterprise exhibit at the Smithsonian National Museum of American History in 2015.

Open Extended Reactions

Wide receiver Julio Jones, a seven-time Pro Bowl selection, signed a one-year contract with the Philadelphia Eagles on Tuesday.

Jones, 34, will be reunited with former Tennessee Titans teammate A.J. Brown, who pushed for Tennessee to trade for him in 2021.

The Eagles recently placed wide receiver Quez Watkins on injured reserve with a hamstring injury and worked out receivers Marquez Callaway and Dezmon Patmon on Monday. In the end, they turned to Jones, who will be on his fourth team in four years.

Jones' 13,629 career receiving yards are the most of any active player in the NFL.

Along with previously playing with Brown in Tennessee, Jones also previously played with Eagles receiver Olamide Zaccheaus when the two were together with the Atlanta Falcons from 2019 to 2020.

Jones is the Falcons' franchise-record holder in receiving yards (12,896), receptions (848), single-season receptions (136), single-season receiving yards (1,871), 100-yard games (58) and 1,000-yard seasons (seven).

Jones, who played for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers last season, has 50 catches for 804 yards and five touchdowns in seven career games against the Eagles, including a game-winning touchdown in 2019.

Now, he'll try to bring some of that to Philadelphia as the Eagles' potential No. 3 receiver behind Brown and DeVonta Smith."

On the release date of the ""Red Table Talk"" host's memoir ""Worthy,"" which detailed how she and Smith quietly separated ""in every way except legally"" in 2016, the Oscar winner had some fun with the interest surrounding their unconventional relationship. In a video shared on Oct. 17, Smith wrote in the caption, ""OFFICIAL STATEMENT.""

""Here's the thing,"" the 55-year-old began in the clip. ""My opinion is...""

However, before finishing the sentence, Smith was interrupted by his itchy nose. As he sneezed into his sleeve, the camera zoomed out to reveal various landscapes around the globe and beyond.

The ruse certainly turned some heads, with comedian King Bach writing in the comments section alongside a laughing emoji, ""Bless you.""

""I'm going to use this next time somebody asks me about politics,"" beatboxer Adym Evans quipped, while film producer Brad Haugen remarked, ""Needed you to weigh in with this opinion. It's on point!""

Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith's Wildest Quotes About Each Other

But jokes aside, Smith has been open about his thoughts on Jada Pinkett Smith's book, which also addressed her private struggles with depression and the infamous Oscars slap. ""When you've been with someone for more than half of your life a sort of emotional blindness sets in,"" he recently told the New York Times in an email. ""You can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties.""

In a separate note to Jada Pinkett Smith, he told the 52-year-old, ""I applaud and honor you.""

""If I had read this book 30 years ago, I definitely would have hugged you more,"" Smith wrote in the letter, which was read aloud to the ""Girls Trip"" actress by Jay Shetty during her appearance on his ""On Purpose"" podcast. ""I'll start now. Welcome to the author's club. I love you endlessly. Now go get some Merlot and take a rest."""
515,2023/10/17, 'england vs italy',https://sports.yahoo.com/england-vs-italy-live-euro-164118391.html,"England wrapped up qualification for Euro 2024 with two matches to spare as Harry Kane’s brace helped Gareth Southgate’s side secure a 3-1 comeback win againstItaly.

Italy stood in their way of early progress as these nations met at Wembley for the first time since they pipped Southgate’s men to European Championship glory on penalties.

England have come a long way in the intervening 27 months and emphatically bounced back from former West Ham striker Gianluca Scamacca’s early gut punch under the arch.

Kane struck from the spot after Giovanni Di Lorenzo brought down the brilliant Jude Bellingham in the box, putting the hosts on course for the point they needed to go through.

But England wanted more and returned from the break with the bit between their teeth, with Real Madrid star Bellingham beginning a brilliant counter-attack that ended with him playing in Marcus Rashford to rifle home.

It will have been a special moment given the England forward missed one of the penalties against Italy and Kane added late gloss as the skipper looks forward to leading the national team to next year’s Euros.

England have qualified for Euro 2024 — now it’s about winning it

22:00 , Jamie Braidwood

The main fact of this 3-1 win was that England have qualified for Euro 2024, but the whole feel was why they should be talking about winning it rather than being too concerned any more with the formality of getting there.

A historic major nation like Italy were just made look a minor inconvenience, as Gareth Southgate’s side almost toyed with them. They were just so much better, and have a knowledge of that personified in Jude Bellingham. Harry Kane got two and Marcus Rashford scored a brilliant goal to make it 2-1, but all of that seemed mere detail to the main event, which was the Real Madrid midfielder’s domination of the pitch and decoration of the play.

This England era has now been going on for at least six years, but it is possible that Bellingham’s emergence marks the beginning of something else. He has exactly the type of assurance that can turn fine challengers into elite champions. It is visible in everything he does, not least the outrageous touch for the Rashford goal that sent England to Germany for next summer.

Bellingham is exactly what England have been missing, for far more reasons than his position and his talent.

England have qualified for Euro 2024 — now it’s about winning it

Jude Bellingham once again proves he is the key for England’s Euro 2024 hopes

22:03 , Mike Jones

A couple of weeks earlier, Giovanni Di Lorenzo had perhaps the best view of Jude Bellingham’s burgeoning greatness. Not from his perspective, admittedly; there was little enjoyable about it as, close as he was, he was also powerless, backtracking as Bellingham slalomed through the Napoli defence, scoring for Real Madrid after a mesmeric solo run.

If the Napoli captain was determined to avert a repeat, he did when Bellingham surged clear. The methodology was agricultural, the cost a penalty for a scything challenge. Neither approach worked, each brought a goal, the second a Harry Kane spot kick. But if one of the world’s best right-backs struggled to find an answer to the question of how to stop Bellingham, he was not alone.

Bryan Cristante, seeing the prodigy in full flight, opted for a nudge in the back. It proved a cunning tactic, conceding a free kick, but not incurring a booking. Poor Francesco Acerbi found himself stranded in no-man’s land, lobbed brilliantly by Bellingham as he sent Marcus Rashford away to score the goal that, along with Kane’s clincher, sealed England’s place in Euro 2024.

Jude Bellingham once again proves he is the key for England’s Euro 2024 hopes

FT England 3-1 Italy

21:59 , Jamie Braidwood

England have qualified for Euro 2024 with two games to spare after coming from behind to defeat Italy thanks to two goals from Harry Kane and a brilliant Marcus Rashford strike.

Former West Ham striker Gianluca Scamacca punished some slack England defending to fire Italy into an early lead, in what was a rematch of the Euro 2020 final at Wembley.

But England hit back as Kane converted a 32nd-minute penalty, which was won by Jude Bellingham following a bursting run into the Italy box.

And Bellingham was heavily involved again as he led an England counter-attack after the break, creating space for Rashford to slam a powerful strike into the corner.

Kane made sure of the victory with another breakaway goal late on - his 61st for England - and it means Gareth Southgate’s side can now begin their preparations for Germany next summer.

More from Kane who spoke to BBC 5 Live

22:16 , Mike Jones

“I feel like sometimes we make qualifying look easy, so credit to the boys because it’s not. We’ve had one of the toughest groups, you’ve seen over recent years some big nations not going to major tournaments, so to do it [qualify] with two games to spare just shows the path we are on.

“We can enjoy it, it was a really good performance from everyone, even when we went one nil down there was no panic. We stayed calm and carried on doing what we have done the whole campaign and obviously got the rewards in the second half.

“We’ve beaten big nations quite consistently over the last few years. To win in Italy is one thing, but to back it up here too, with the performance, 3-1, comfortable for us, I think we showed a real maturity out there.

“We won’t get carried away. Enjoy the next camp, two more games to work together. Then these tournaments come around quick. Before we know it we’ll be in March and on the eve of the next tournament.”

22:14 , Mike Jones

Harry Kane’s brace tonight saw him overtake Bobby Charlton (23) to become England’s all-time top scorer at Wembley (24 goals).

Post-match reaction from Harry Kane

22:05 , Mike Jones

England captain Harry Kane, speaking on Channel 4: “Qualifying is never easy. Sometimes we are just expected to go to the big tournaments but we have seen in the past it is not as easy as it looks.

“We went 1-0 behind and stayed calm. We knew we coiuld get the winner and we have done it.

“I do [enjoy scoring at Wembley] It is our home. We have made it a real fortress over the years. We want to repay our fans with victories and we have done that today.

“I showed a bit of pace [for his second goal] which is not normally my strength. To qualify with two games to go, credit to everyone involved.”

90+3 mins: There goes the final whistle! England have qualified for Euro 2024 and join Scotland at next year’s tournament in Germany.

Italy suffer their first defeat under manager Luciano Spalletti and it’s been a deserved win for the Three Lions. The first half was a fairly even affair, reflected in the 1-1 scoreline at the break.

In the second 45 minutes though, England took control. Jude Bellingham, Marcus Rashford, Harry Kane and Phil Foden were all fantastic and helped the hosts push higher up the pitch easing the pressure on the defence.

Kane and Rashford both scored and Italy’s resolve wilted. Job done.

21:30 , Mike Jones

83 mins: Should Gareth Southgate’s men see this one out, it’ll be their 19th match unbeaten at Wembley.

England 3-1 Italy

21:28 , Mike Jones

80 mins: Into the final 10 minutes of the match now and England have a two goal cushion thanks to second half strikes from Marcus Rashford and Harry Kane.

England 2-1 Italy

21:12 , Mike Jones

65 mins: Marc Guehi comes on for England, replacing John Stones in central defence. Stones is just returning from injury so it’s probably a precautionary measure from Gareth Southgate.

21:09 , Mike Jones

63 mins: Close! Harry Kane drops deep to receive the ball. He whips a cross field pass over to Marcus Rashford who dribbles to the edge of the box, rolls onto his right foot and drills a shot wide for the far post.

21:06 , Mike Jones

60 mins: It was a superb finish from Rashford but the goal came from the smarts and awareness of Bellingham. Both men have put in strong showings tonight and they’ve combined to give England the edge on the game now.

45+3 mins: All square at Wembley. Italy took the lead with a sweeping move before Harry Kane equalised from the penalty spot. England need to creat a few more chances from open play to really hone in on a win here.

The substitutions may prove crucial as the match goes one. Everything is still to play for.

20:36 , Mike Jones

45+2 mins: Save! Destiny Udogie is fed the ball on the left side of the pitch and weaves his way into the penalty area with England too scared to put in the tackle.

A quick check to his right sees him work the ball onto his right foot and he guides a shot to the far corner only for Jordan Pickford to drop low and push it into the middle of the box.

There’s a scramble and a hope for Italy to get a second but the ball is deflected over the top of the goal.

Donnarumma spies it early and gets across to smother it.

England 0-1 Italy

20:14 , Mike Jones

21 mins: England want to pass the ball quickly but inside the final third, Italy are closing them down quickly. Rashford is given the ball and by the time he spins towards goal, three defenders are on top of him and he loses possession.

At the other end of the pitch, Scamacca has a go from the edge of the box but this one is pulled wide of the nearest post.

18 mins: England look all at sea in defence. A simple forward pass comes over to El Shaarway but Kyle Walker manages to get a head to the ball first.

It drops to a forward thinking Davide Frattesi who tries to shift it onto his right foot. As he’s lining up a shot, Walker gets across him and shields the ball long enough for Jordan Pickford to get out and scoop it up.

England need to sharpen up, that goal is feeding confidence into Italy.

12 mins: England win a free kick smack bang in front of goal about 25-yards out from the target. Kieran Trippier and Marcus Rashford are the two standing over the ball but it’s Rashford who goes for goal.

He smokes it pretty well but there’s not enough dip on the shot to get it below the crossbar. Decent effort though.

England 0-0 Italy

11 mins: Kalvin Phillips has arrived late or two of three tackles so far, probably due to his lack of match fitness, and is the first man to go in the book for catching his man.

3 mins: The equation is simple for England. If they avoid defeat, they’ll qualify for Euro 2024.

Gareth Southgate’s men have made a decent start to the match. They’re knocking the ball around confidently and looking to work Italy out of position.

The minute’s silence for the victims in Palestine, Israel and Belgium precedes kick off at Wembley. Jude Bellingham gets proceedings underway with a pass to John Stones who pings a forward ball up towards Harry Kane on the left side of the pitch.

Southgate on Phillips

19:42 , Mike Jones

England boss Gareth Southgate, spoke about why he decided to go with Kalvin Phillips in midfield this evening: “It is tactical. I felt Kalvin did a really good job against Scotland.

“He is a different sort of player to Hendo.

“Tonight is a really good test against one of the top nations in the world. We have to go and cause them as many problems as we can.”

A moment of silence to precede tonight’s fixture

19:40 , Mike Jones

A moment of silence will precede all of Tuesday's Euro 2024 qualifying matches, including England vs Italy, in memory of ""members of the European football family killed in recent days in Europe and Israel"", European soccer's governing body Uefa said in a statement.

Two Swedish football fans were fatally shot in Brussels by a suspected Islamist militant on Monday ahead of Sweden's qualifying match with Belgium. The game at King Baudouin Stadium, about 5 km from the shootings, was initially suspended and then abandoned at half-time.

Hamas fighters killed 1,300 Israelis on Oct. 7 in the deadliest Palestinian militant attack in Israel's history. Israel has responded with intensive air strikes that have killed more than 2,800 Palestinians.

Tuesday's five qualifiers feature Finland hosting Kazakhstan, Serbia at home to Montenegro, Denmark visiting San Marino, Italy playing at England, and Malta hosting Ukraine.

Kyle Walker eyes ‘little bit of payback’ as England host Italy

19:35 , Mike Jones

Kyle Walker is eyeing “a little bit of payback” when England host Italy at Wembley tonight. This Euro 2024 qualifier is the first time these sides have met at Wembley since the Azzurri pipped Gareth Southgate’s men on penalties in the Euro 2020 showpiece.

Walker admits the chance to put that ghost to bed adds a little extra spice to proceedings this evening, but the main focus is getting the point England need to seal qualification with two games to spare.

“Listen, we fell short on that night,” said Walker of the Euro 2020 final, “This is the first time they’re coming back to Wembley, so hopefully we can go out there and put a good performance on and maybe get a little bit of payback.

“I think you learn from occasions where you’ve been in finals and lose finals and setbacks, and you go on and achieve something great.

“We get a draw and we go through, so it’s about managing the game. Obviously, first and foremost, it’s about going out and putting a performance on and winning.

“But I won’t be ashamed if it’s 0-0 and we’re in the Euros and we’re going to represent my country at the finals.”

Can Luciano Spalletti remake his Napoli recipe in charge of Italy?

19:30 , Mike Jones

Luciano Spalletti was supposed to be on his Tuscan farm now. Arguably, though, he should still be at Napoli, managing what had looked like Europe’s most unexpectedly entertaining side. Instead, he will be at Wembley on Tuesday, in charge of Italy, his appointment a consequence of a combination of factors from the personal to the political, the footballing to the financial. Or, in a different way, of two emails.

One, triggering the extension in his Napoli contract without a pay rise, stemmed from club president Aurelio De Laurentiis, and instead prompted his resignation. A need for a sabbatical on his farm the cited reason; a breakdown in relationships more of a cause. The other, from Roberto Mancini’s camp a few months later, was his sudden resignation as Italy manager, the first to lead the Azzurri to a major title since Enzo Bearzot, trading the patriotism of leading his country for a reported £20m a year to take charge of Saudi Arabia instead.

And so it will be Spalletti in England, his presence a product of the enduring pulling power of the Azzurri job. While elite club coaches often eschew the international game, three of the last four incumbents, including Antonio Conte, are Scudetto winners, whereas no England manager has won the Premier League or the old Division 1 since Don Revie. It comes after the greatest feat of a career in the dugout that dates back three decades.

Can Luciano Spalletti remake his Napoli recipe in charge of struggling Italy?

England vs Italy

Italy manager Luciano Spalletti’s previous game at Wembley came while in charge of Inter Milan, losing 1-0 in November 2018 against Spurs in a Uefa Champions League match.

The last four Italy managers to face England for the first time have all drawn, with Giovanni Trappatoni the last manager to beat the Three Lions in their first game against them (1-0 in November 2000).

Harry Kane has been directly involved in at least one goal in 17 of his 18 appearances in European Championship qualifying for England (20 goals, eight assists), including the last 14 in a row.

The only game he didn’t score or assist in was against Estonia in October 2015.

England vs Italy

19:15 , Mike Jones

Should Declan Rice or Harry Kane score for England in this match, they could emulate Tommy Lawton in scoring in consecutive appearances for the Three Lions against Italy, with Lawton the only player to ever do so, with his goals coming nine years and three days apart between 1939 and 1948.

England vs Italy

19:10 , Mike Jones

England have suffered just one defeat in their last 62 major tournament qualifiers (World Cup/Euros), a 2-1 reverse away at Czechia in October 2019 (49 wins, 12 draws).

At home, the Three Lions are unbeaten in their last 35 such games (31 wins, four draws) since losing to 3-2 to Croatia in November 2007 under Steve McClaren.

England fans may have turned on Jordan Henderson — but he still has Gareth Southgate

19:05 , Mike Jones

It was a character reference for a man who has become an ambassador of sorts for Saudi Arabia. The England faithful – or some of them, anyway – had turned on Jordan Henderson when he was booed off in Friday’s win over Australia. The England manager offered an endorsement of his vice-captain: not merely as a midfielder, either, but as a principled individual.

The Henderson of Al-Ettifaq, the man who used to support the NHS and the LGBTQ community instead plugging Saudi’s 2034 World Cup bid, stands accused of either being the opposite of the Liverpool incarnation or a figure whose decision to join the Saudi Pro League led him to become a public face of a repressive regime.

Gareth Southgate can see why many have a sense of disappointment, why there is a seeming contradiction. Yet he also argued that Henderson remains the same person, one who has helped create the right kind of culture with England.

Italy haven’t lost any of their last 22 away European Championship qualifiers (17 wins, five draws) since a 3-1 defeat to France in September 2006.

If they avoid defeat here, they would set a new record for unbeaten away Euros qualifiers – Romania also had a 22-game run between 1991 and 2007.

Gareth Southgate addresses Jordan Henderson criticism ahead of Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy

England football manager Gareth Southgate addressed criticism directed towards Jordan Henderson following his move to Saudi Arabia.

“I’ll always pick the players that I think are the best players to represent the team,” he told a press conference on Monday, 16 October, ahead of a Euro 2024 qualifier against Italy.

England vs Italy - Team news!

18:39 , Mike Jones

Gareth Southgate changes his entire starting XI as England set out to qualify for Euro 2024 with at least a draw against Italy.

The England manager had fielded a much-changed side for Friday’s 1-0 friendly win over Australia but the more established names returned.

Captain Harry Kane led the line while Southgate kept faith with Harry Maguire and Kalvin Phillips despite the minimal game-time for their respective clubs.

England’s last Wembley fixture against Italy was the Euro 2020 final defeat and eight of that side started here, while only three from the victorious Azzurri team made it into this clash - Gianluigi Donnarumma, Giovanni Di Lorenzo and Nicolo Barella.

England XI: Pickford, Walker, Stones, Maguire, Trippier, Phillips, Rice, Foden, Bellingham, Rashford, Kane

Gareth Southgate vowed not to let a “popularity contest” sway his selections as the England boss threw his full support behind Jordan Henderson days after the stand-in skipper was jeered off at Wembley.

The Euro 2020 runners-up are within touching distance of qualifying for next summer’s finals and will seal their spot in Germany should they avoid defeat to Italy on Tuesday evening.

Wembley will welcome a second sell-out crowd in five days after Friday’s friendly against Australia brought an impressive turnout for what proved to be a largely forgettable 1-0 friendly win.

Southgate aiming to qualify for Euro 2024

18:20 , Mike Jones

Gareth Southgate says his England team are determined to keep producing memorable nights for the fans and says that qualifying for major tournaments is a big step towards that goal.

The Three Lions need just a draw against Italy to secure their place at next summer’s Euro 2024, due to their head-to-head record over the other teams, but Southgate is determined to win all three points this evening.

“Ultimately, the first objective is always to qualify for the tournaments and our performances earlier in the group have put us in a really strong position,” he said,

“So the first thing we want to do is play well and win the game but we know if it’s the 87th minute and we’re level, then we don’t need to lob the goalkeeper into the box at the end of the game.”

England vs Italy last three meetings

18:15 , Mike Jones

Things are usually fairly equal when the Three Lions take on Italy with most matches being decided by the odd goal here or there. Over the last three fixtures there has been one win and one loss for each team with a draw also being shared.

Here are the last three England vs Italy results:

Italy 1-2 England - 23 March 2023, Stadio Diego Armando Maradona, Napoli

Italy 1-0 England - 23 September 2022, San Siro, Milan

England 0-0 Italy - 11 June 2022, Molineux, Wolverhampton

England vs Italy

18:10 , Mike Jones

The Three Lions have met Italy on 31 previous occasions over the years, with England winning nine times, drawing nine times and losing 13 times. The first meeting between the teams came back in May 1933, when it ended in a 1-1 draw in Rome.

Will England add to their winning tally this evening?

Where and when is Uefa Euro 2024?

After a winter World Cup in Qatar which saw Argentina defeat France in an unbelievable final, the qualifying rounds for Uefa Euro 2024 are here.

If it feels like that’s come around quickly, that’s because it has. The World Cup taking place in December 2022 rather than the tradtional summer slot meant that there was only 18 months between the World Cup and the Euros, rather than the customary two years.

The last European Championship was delayed due to Covid and took place all over Europe with many games taking place at Wembley. It was Wembley where England heartbreakingly lost the final to Italy on penalties after taking an extremely early lead on the night through Luke Shaw.

Gareth Southgate is likely to revert to his full-strength, first choice XI this evening after fielding a relatively inexperienced line-up against Australia last week.

The quality in the England side, added to the fact they are playing at home, should be enough to see them edge out Italy and secure their place in the Euro 2024.

England 1-0 Italy.

17:50 , Mike Jones

Having made a second-string side for their friendly against Australia on Friday, Southgate will likely return to a full-strength side for this must-win clash. Bukayo Saka remains an absentee after his hamstring injury for Arsenal, while Kieran Trippier could deputise at left-back in the absence of both Ben Chilwell and Luke Shaw who are out with long-term injuries.

Premier League duo Sandro Tonalia and Nicolo Zaniolo remain unavailable for their national side having withdrawn from the squad after their pair were questioned in relation to a gambling investigation by Italian authorities.

Elsewhere, Spalleti will have to deal with a number of injuries in the forward line with Federico Chiesa and Ivan Provedel both withdrawing from the squad due to respective fitness issues. In their absence, Sassuolo forward Domenico Berardi looks set to retain his place in the forward line having scored his first goal for Italy in two years against Malta last weekend.

519,2023/10/18, 'wife of will smith',https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/oct/19/will-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-memoir-worthy-baltimore,"Will Smith has made an emotional speech in support of his wife Jada Pinkett Smith at a promotional event for her new memoir Worthy, describing their marriage as “a sloppy public experiment in unconditional love”.

In remarks reported by the Baltimore Sun, Smith said: “I just really wanted to come out and just be here and hold it down for you the way you have held it down for me … We have had a very, very long and tumultuous [relationship]. We call it ‘brutiful’… brutal and beautiful at the same time.”

Smith added: “Our union is a sloppy public experiment. It is a sloppy public experiment in unconditional love … As I stand here before you today, I am happier than I’ve ever been in my entire life … I have achieved every single thing I have ever wanted in my entire life.”

Smith was speaking at an event at Baltimore’s Enoch Pratt Library for Worthy, Pinkett Smith’s memoir in which she revealed that the couple, who married in 1997, have been living separate lives since 2016. Smith’s infamous “slap” at the 2022 Oscar ceremony was apparently triggered by Smith taking exception at a joke by host Chris Rock at Pinkett Smith’s expense, after which he shouted: “Keep my wife’s name out of your fucking mouth.”

Since Pinkett Smith’s revelations about their relationship, an email from Smith was quoted in a New York Times interview with Pinkett Smith, in which he reportedly said that the memoir “woke him up” and that “when you’ve been with someone for more than half of your life a sort of emotional blindness sets in, and you can all too easily lose your sensitivity to their hidden nuances and subtle beauties.” Smith subsequently posted a joke “official statement” on social media, featuring the actor sneezing."
520,2023/10/18, 'natalee holloway',https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/18/us/joran-van-der-sloot-natalee-holloway-plea-wednesday/index.html,"Birmingham, Alabama CNN —

Almost two decades after Natalee Holloway vanished in Aruba, the man long suspected in her death has confessed to killing the Alabama teen in grisly detail, court documents reveal.

But it remains unclear whether Joran van der Sloot, 36, will ever serve time for bludgeoning Holloway to death on the Caribbean island. While Aruba’s statute of limitations for homicide may have passed, the public prosecutor’s office there has not closed the door on possible legal action.

Van der Sloot’s confession was publicized shortly after he pleaded guilty in an Alabama federal court Wednesday to extorting and defrauding Holloway’s family.

He was accused of trying to sell information about the location of Holloway’s remains to her mother, Beth Holloway, in exchange for $250,000.

The plea deal appeared to benefit both van der Sloot and the Holloway family. Van der Sloot was sentenced to 20 years for the financial crimes, which will run simultaneously with his ongoing prison sentence in Peru – where he was convicted of killing another woman and trafficking cocaine.

And while the US does not have jurisdiction over Holloway’s homicide case in Aruba, her parents now have certainty as to who killed their daughter.

“It’s over. Joran van der Sloot is no longer the suspect in my daughter’s murder. He is the killer,” Beth Holloway said Wednesday.

“After 18 years, Natalee’s case is solved,” she said. “He gave a proffer in which he finally confessed to killing Natalee.”

In a proffer, a defendant offers information they know about a crime, often as part of a plea deal.

Van der Sloot admitted to killing the teen with a cinder block on an Aruban beach after she rejected his sexual advances, according to a transcript of an interview with his attorney.

Van der Sloot said Holloway kneed him in the crotch after he tried “feeling her up,” and he responded by kicking her in the face and bludgeoning her with the cinder block.

He then decided to “push her off” into the ocean, according to the interview transcript.

Holloway’s body has never been found. In 2012, a judge signed an order declaring her legally dead.

Five years after Holloway’s death, van der Sloot killed a Peruvian woman, 21-year-old Stephany Flores, in 2010.

Van der Sloot has admitted to killing Flores and was sentenced to 28 years in prison for her death.

The young women’s deaths prompted US federal Judge Anna Manasco to sentence van der Sloot to 20 years for the extortion and wire fraud charges.

“I have considered your confession to the brutal murder of Natalee Holloway,” Manasco said Wednesday.

“You have brutally murdered, in separate incidents years apart, two beautiful women who refused your sexual advances.”

Holloway’s homicide investigation isn’t over

Van der Sloot was arrested multiple times in connection with Holloway’s death between 2005 and 2007. But he was released by Aruban authorities, who cited a lack of direct evidence.

On Thursday, a spokesperson for the Aruba Public Prosecutor’s Office did not rule out the possibility that van der Sloot could face new legal action in Aruba after he confessed to killing Holloway.

“The Public Prosecutor’s Office will reiterate once more that the Holloway case remains an open investigation in Aruba,” spokesperson Ann Angela told CNN in an email.

In light of van der Sloot’s confession, Aruban authorities “have requested the U.S. Department of Justice for official court documents and transcripts and all documents related to the investigation, which we will review before deciding on the procedural steps to be taken.”

In Aruba, the statute of limitations for homicide has been 12 years. When asked whether or why the statute of limitations might not apply to van der Sloot, the spokesperson said the question “cannot be answered unequivocally.”

“It depends on several factors within the investigation,” Angela said Thursday. “Bear in mind also that we don’t know yet what is in the official court documents and documents related to the investigation. Therefore there is no simple yes or no at this moment.”

But Van der Sloot is scheduled to spend the next two decades behind bars in Peru.

In addition to his 28-year prison sentence for murdering Flores, van der Sloot was also convicted in 2021 of trafficking cocaine into his Peruvian prison. He was sentenced to an additional 18 years in Peru, according to a sentencing memorandum.

“Because Peruvian law prohibits prison sentences from exceeding a total of 35 years (unless given a life sentence), the Defendant is currently scheduled for release from prison in Peru on or about June 10, 2045 (35 years after his original arrest in Peru),” the court document states.

But Peruvian officials allowed his temporary release to the US in June to face the extortion and wire fraud charges.

Van der Sloot was expected to return to Peru to finish his murder sentence in the Flores case before returning to the US to serve time for the federal charges.

But Wednesday’s plea agreement says his 20-year US federal sentence will be served concurrently with his sentence in Peru. In other words, it appears unlikely van der Sloot will return to the US to serve prison time.

18 years of mystery and misery

Holloway was visiting Aruba on a high school graduation trip when she vanished in 2005.

Natalee Holloway Natalee Holloway Family

The 18-year-old was last seen leaving a nightclub with van der Sloot and two other men, brothers Deepak and Satish Kalpoe.

The three men were arrested in 2005 but were released due to insufficient evidence.

They were rearrested and charged in 2007 for “involvement in the voluntary manslaughter of Natalee Holloway or causing serious bodily harm to Natalee Holloway, resulting in her death,” Aruban prosecutors said at the time.

But a few weeks later, an Aruban judge ordered van der Sloot’s release, citing a lack of direct evidence that Holloway died from a violent crime or that van der Sloot was involved in such a crime. The Kalpoe brothers were also released.

Why van der Sloot was charged in the US

While US officials don’t have jurisdiction over the criminal investigation in Aruba, a federal grand jury in Alabama indicted van der Sloot for an alleged plot to sell information about Holloway’s remains to her family.

According to the indictment, van der Sloot’s scheme took place between March and May 2010.

He was indicted in June 2010 on charges of extortion and wire fraud.

In the weeks between his extortion and indictment, van der Sloot killed Flores on May 30, 2010, in his hotel room in Peru."
521,2023/10/18, 'argentina vs peru',https://www.mlssoccer.com/news/messi/lionel-messi-golazos-lift-argentina-past-peru-in-world-cup-qualifier,"Inter Miami CF superstar Lionel Messi wrote more history Tuesday evening, becoming Conmebol's all-time leading scorer in World Cup qualifying after tallying twice in Argentina's 2-0 win at Peru.

Powered by their captain and No. 10, La Albiceleste have enjoyed a perfect 4W-0L-0D start as their 2026 World Cup cycle gets underway in hopes of defending their 2022 title.

The Heronsâ blockbuster summer signing, who sent two stunning left-footed finishes past Orlando City SC goalkeeper Pedro Gallese , surpassed ex-FC Barcelona teammate and Uruguay star Luis SuÃ¡rez. Messi now has 31 goals in South American WCQs, while SuÃ¡rez has 29.

Messi returned for an appearance off the bench in Miami's 1-0 defeat to FC Cincinnati on Oct. 7, a result that ensured Miami can't qualify for the Audi 2023 MLS Playoffs.

This was Messi's first start since a 4-0 win over Toronto FC on Sept. 20 that contributed to a four-game spell on the injury list due to lingering muscle fatigue.

While Messi's availability will be determined before Saturdayâs Decision Day finale against Charlotte FC (6 pm ET | MLS Season Pass), any doubts about his health and impact were put to rest with Tuesdayâs brilliant display.

It also recalled some of Messiâs spectacular performances over the summer with Miami, as the seven-time Ballon dâOr winner â with help from fellow marquee signings Sergio Busquets and Jordi Alba â led the Herons to Leagues Cup 2023 glory and the US Open Cup Final."
522,2023/10/19,'burt young',https://variety.com/2023/film/news/burt-young-dead-rocky-1235761505/,"Burt Young, who played Paulie in six of the “Rocky” films starring Sylvester Stallone, drawing an Oscar nomination for supporting actor for his performance in the 1976 original, has died, his daughter Anne Morea Steingieser confirmed to the New York Times. He was 83.

Roger Ebert gave Young his props for his performance in the first “Rocky” film: “And Burt Young as (Adrian’s) brother — defeated and resentful, loyal and bitter, caring about people enough to hurt them just to draw attention to his grief.” The New York Times — in an absolutely scathing, completely dismissive review of the film — nevertheless said: “Burt Young is effective as Rocky’s best friend, a beer-guzzling mug.”

Young’s temperamental, jealous but nonetheless loyal and caring Paulie Pennino was Rocky’s best friend — he would defend the Italian Stallion if someone insulted him. But he was a problematic friend who shouts at Adrian during her pregnancy, resulting in the premature birth of Rocky’s son; draws Balboa into a street fight; and in 1990’s “Rocky V,” is the cause of the Balboas’ bankruptcy.

In 2006’s “Rocky Balboa,” Paulie is back where he started, working at the meat-packing plant, but he’s laid off and loses his skepticism about Rocky’s return to the ring and serves as his cornerman. Young did not appear in 2015’s “Creed,” as Paulie is said to have died in 2012.

The exceptionally prolific Young — who was never much to look at, making him the perfect character actor — had a way of taking a thug or a goon or a mug and giving him more personality, more sympathy, somehow, than the role deserved.

In a negative 2011 review of Robert Aldrich’s 1977 police dramedy “The Choirboys,” a poor adaptation of the Joseph Wambaugh novel, critic Richard Winters wrote: “There are a few bright spots. I really liked the Burt Young character. Many people remember him best from the ‘Rocky’ movies. Here he plays an incredibly grungy, crass police sergeant who exposes a tender side at a completely unexpected moment.”

Young played one of the truckers in Sam Peckinpah’s execrable “Convoy” (1978), starring Kris Kristofferson, and played the chauffeur and bodyguard of the Rodney Dangerfield character in the 1986 comedy “Back to School.”

Another example of the actor managing to score despite a generally mediocre film was Robert Aldrich’s 1981 girls wrestling film “All the Marbles,” starring Peter Falk. Critic Dennis Schwartz wrote in 2011: “Burt Young as the oily wrestling promoter who resents Falk for his independence, has a nice turn in a supporting role.”

In a memorable scene in Sergio Leone’s “Once Upon a Time in America” (1984) that also featured a young Joe Pesci, Young played a hood who eats crudely and tells a very off-color story about how he got clued into a Detroit diamond shipment ripe for heisting. The actor played Bed Bug Eddie, a vindictive mobster whose $150,0000 the two protagonists in 1984’s “The Pope of Greenwich Village,” played by Eric Roberts and Mickey Rourke, unwisely steal from a safe.

In another characterful turn, in Uli Edel’s 1990 film “Last Exit to Brooklyn,” he played Big Joe, one of many who’s thrown out of work by the strike at the heart of the movie. He is violent, none too bright and yet somehow a decent man concerned about his family — a classic Burt Young character. Big Joe’s wife tells one day that his daughter, played by Ricki Lake, is eight months pregnant, to which he replies, “She’s just fat.”

In the 1999 romantic comedy “Mickey Blue Eyes,” in which Hugh Grant falls in love with a gal (Jeanne Tripplehorn) from a mobbed-up family, James Caan played her father and Young played the big boss. By this point Young had made as many movies with Caan as he had with Stallone.

In 2006’s “Transamerica,” in which Felicity Huffman delightfully played a very proper pre-op transsexual who’s traveling across the country, Fionnula Flanagan and Young played her crass parents, whom she visits in Phoenix.

In Tom McCarthy’s 2011 film “Win Win,” Paul Giamatti played a fed-up lawyer who double crosses his client (Young), who’s moving into Alzheimer’s but refusing to leave his home, by becoming his legal guardian and moving him into a nursing home.

The actor had a supporting role in Raymond De Felitta’s 2014 crime drama “Rob the Mob,” starring Michael Pitt and Ray Romano.

Young tried series-regular television with the NBC comedy “Roomies” (1987), about a 50-year-old former Marine sergeant who rooms with a young genius, played by Corey Haim, when they both go to college, but the show lasted only eight episodes.

Young appeared in TV movies and guested on “Tales From the Crypt,” “Columbo,” “The Outer Limits,” “Russian Doll” and even “Walker, Texas Ranger.” More fittingly, he appeared in a 2001 episode of “The Sopranos” as the father of Steve Schirripa’s Bobby “Bacala” Baccalieri. Tony mentions to Bobby “Bacala” that it was odd that he’d never whacked anyone considering his father, who fronted as a barber, was “the fuckin Terminator in that respect.”

Young’s Bobby Sr., who’s suffering from lung cancer, comes out of retirement after Tony gives him the job of killing Salvatore “Mustang Sally” Intile, but he died after choking on blood, losing control of his car and crashing into a sign post while leaving the scene of his final hit.

More impressive, however, was the actor’s masterful performance in a 1997 episode of “Law & Order” called “Mad Dog.” He played a paroled sex offender who’s presumed to be guilty of newly committed crimes fairly similar to those that got him incarcerated, but he’s put under so much pressure by the police and especially Sam Waterston’s executive D.A. McCoy that, ultimately, he is perhaps forced into reoffending, with disastrous results. (Young also later appeared on an episode of “Law & Order: SVU.”)

Young was born in Queens, New York, to parents of Italian heritage; in a 1978 article, People magazine said Young was mysterious about many details of his past, including his family’s original last name. He dropped out of school when he was 15 to join the Marines, serving from 1957-59. He was trained by Lee Strasberg at the Actors Studio.

The actor made his uncredited screen debut as a bartender in an episode of “The Doctors” in 1969. The next year he made his big-screen debut (credited as John Harris) in the horror film “Carnival of Blood.” He had a small part as a hood in Ivan Passer’s “Born to Win” (1971), which starred George Segal and Paula Prentiss and featured a young Robert De Niro, and appeared in the crime comedy “The Gang That Couldn’t Shoot Straight,” starring Jerry Orbach, with De Niro again in a supporting role, and the well-regarded crime drama “Across 110th Street” (1972).

Young had a supporting role in Mark Rydell’s “Cinderella Liberty” (1973), starring James Caan and Marsha Mason, as a Navy master-at-arms, but he first really made an impression in Roman Polanski’s “Chinatown,” as Curly, the fisherman who hired Jack Nicholson’s J.J. Gittes on an earlier case and is willing to help out when Gittes wants Curly to smuggle Faye Dunaway’s Evelyn and her daughter/sister Katherine out of the city and away from John Huston’s Hollis Mulwray — a plan that fails.

In Karel Reisz’s James Toback-scripted “The Gambler” (1974), starring Caan, Young played another hood, but this time he attracted the notice of critic Jonathan Rosenbaum in the Monthly Film Bulletin, who, in a negative review of the film, declared: “It is worth noting that some of the actors do what they can to enliven the relatively marginal parts of the narrative: Burt Young as Carmine, the loan shark hood, describes a parabola from homely amiability to casual brutality that is truly terrifying.”

In Sam Peckinpah’s contemporary action thriller “The Killer Elite” (1975), Young was again reteamed with Caan, playing the loyal driver Mac for Caan’s agent Mike Locken in a movie full of betrayals. (It was in this role that Young caught the attention of Stallone.)

In Mark Rydell’s period heist film “Harry and Walter Go to New York” (1976), starring Caan and Elliott Gould and clearly inspired by “The Sting,” Young got a chance to be on the other side of the law for a change, playing the warden of the prison in which the grand scheme is hatched.

But that same year he made another film that would be far more important in determining the arc of his acting career: the John G. Avildsen-directed “Rocky,” scripted by Stallone and with Young third billed as Paulie.

Young penned the screenplays to the 1978 CBS TV movie “Daddy, I Don’t Like It Like This” and the 1978 film “Uncle Joe Shannon,” in which he starred as the title character.

Stallone paid tribute to his “Rocky” co-star on Instagram, writing, “To my dear friend, Burt Young, you were an incredible man’s and artist, I and the World will miss you very much.”

Young’s wife Gloria died in 1974. He is survived by a daughter, Anne Morea."
523,2023/10/19, 'prickly plant part',https://www.nationalgeographic.com/animals/article/phasmids-stick-leaf-insects-eggs-camouflouge,"These herbivores look like leaves, twigs, and bark—giving new meaning to the phrase “You are what you eat.” Phasmids, commonly known as stick or leaf insects, often fade into the flora to become virtually invisible. It’s an effective survival strategy: Their predators want to snack on an insect, so they ignore what appears to be a plant.

(Can you spot these hidden animals?)

Like the vegetation they mimic, most phasmids don’t move much, says entomologist Thies Büscher. They find a niche without competition for resources, and over time they’ve evolved to suit their surroundings. Look to similar environments in different parts of the world and you may find species that have survived in the same way: leaf insects that became more brown in arid habitats or green in tropical rainforests.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Camouflage can be part of every stage of a phasmid’s life. The giant prickly stick insect (Extatosoma tiaratum) imitates crumpled foliage as an adult, its nymphs look like ants and then bark, and its eggs look like seeds. The eggs are taken in by spider ants, which eat only the nutrient-rich, knoblike capitulum. When the phasmids hatch, they look similar to their ant guardians, which wards off predators. Then they climb trees, soon becoming indiscernible from the bark. At the treetops, they blend in with the leaves. It’s a life cycle that tells the story of their ecosystem.

Please be respectful of copyright. Unauthorized use is prohibited.

Most phasmid eggs, like the giant prickly stick insect’s, resemble seeds, sometimes those of local plants. For example, the eggs of a leaf insect in Indonesia, Phyllium letiranti, echo the seeds of the tropical ivy gourd plant. Other attributes also increase eggs’ likelihood of survival, Büscher says. Their hardened shells can regulate humidity and radiation, and shiny black spots may play a role in thermoregulation.

Some eggs, such as that of Orestes draegeri, have tiny hairs that function like Velcro, fixing them in place. One successful stick insect (Ramulus mikado) can be found all over the islands of Japan. Though scientists initially thought birds consumed and spread its eggs, experiments showed that the secret was likely in a bittersweet sacrifice: Mothers eaten whole by birds usually contain some eggs that survive.

*Contains spoilers*

“I was taught that if we’re born with love, then life is about choosing the right place to put it.” – Priest (Andrew Scott) Fleabag

Phoebe Waller-Bridge’s Fleabag follows a complex protagonist (Phoebe Waller-Bridge), who viewers simply know as ‘Fleabag’, as she navigates her world of grief, guilt, love, and forgiveness – finding them to be inexorably linked. In the first series, viewers see Fleabag blunder through life as she steals from her godmother (Olivia Colman), pursues multiple sexual partners, and reflects on her role in the death of her best friend Boo (Jenny Rainsford).

Series two depicts Fleabag protecting her sister Claire (Sian Clifford), and exploring the Christian faith whilst falling in love with a priest (Andrew Scott). These events are portrayed through emotional highs and lows as viewers grow tentatively fond of Fleabag’s deeply flawed character.

There are many brilliant aspects of Fleabag that could be invoked in the discussion of what makes the series a ‘classic’. The perverse tragicomedy is filled with intense, witty humour; brilliantly constructed, compelling characters; and an ingenious script which has been published under the name Fleabag: The Scriptures, reflecting the accomplished writing held within. However, I find the most important aspect of Fleabag to be its exploration of forgiveness, and the resulting demonstration of the diverse ways in which it can be given and received. This message, woven into each narrative thread, is what I believe makes Fleabag truly deserving of the ‘classic’ label.

Forgiveness in Fleabag is primarily explored through three of Fleabag’s most central relationships: her relationship with the Priest, with her sister Claire, and with herself.

Fleabag’s Priest represents a theological understanding of guilt and forgiveness. Given his commitment to the Catholic faith, the Priest suggests that the matter of forgiveness is unambiguous: confess and God will forgive you. However, throughout her encounters with the Priest, Fleabag begs the question: where does forgiveness come from in a world without God? This question is especially pertinent given that Fleabag confesses her dark secrets to the audience in series one, to no relief. It appears that Fleabag is drawn to the Priest and his understanding of guilt in her search for forgiveness, urging herself to understand the Priest’s Christian convictions. However, she and the Priest cannot reconcile their ways of life, and Fleabag cannot find forgiveness in his world.

Throughout the series, Fleabag thinks very little of herself, valuing her worth according to her sex appeal

Fleabag’s relationship with her sister Claire represents a form of forgiveness that, if less straightforward than the Priest’s attitude, has a far more tangible effect on her life. The sisters are estranged at the end of series one, following Fleabag’s revelation that Claire’s chauvinistic husband Martin (Brett Gelman) tried to kiss her. Claire chooses to belief Martin, who denies such an act, stating that Fleabag is untrustworthy given her role in Boo’s death. At the start of series two, the sisters have not spoken for a year. However, as the first episode develops it becomes clear that the sisters have forgiven each other. This forgiveness is not represented conventionally, through an emotional apology, or a grand speech. Instead, the forgiveness is implicit, reflected in their actions throughout the episode: after months of no contact, when the sisters need each other for support and protection, they step up in an instant. Wordlessly communicating, as siblings do, they put aside their differences without a hint of resentment and break their year’s silence, looking out for each other above anything else. Forgiveness comes easily to the sisters, reflecting their unbreakable alliance as they stand united against the world.

Despite these sources of forgiveness that surround Fleabag, her grief and guilt do not begin to diminish until she moves towards forgiving herself. Throughout the series, Fleabag thinks very little of herself, valuing her worth according to her sex appeal. She pushes away those who look to connect with her, believing that she is not worthy of a meaningful relationship, given how she destroyed her friendship with Boo. However, following her encounters with the Priest who, given his celibacy, helps her understand that she is valuable beyond the world of sex. She begins to look upon herself in a kinder light. It is through mending her relationship with herself that Fleabag is able to mend her relationship with others and create connections that endure. Fleabag moves towards forgiveness by acknowledging her worth, letting herself stand up for those she cares about and accepting the inevitability of mistakes and the permissibility of moving past them: “People make mistakes. That’s why they put rubbers on the ends of pencils,”. Given this portrayal of introspective forgiveness, Fleabag delivers a powerful story about personal growth and self-love.

Waller-Bridge delivers a masterclass in beautiful, concise writing. Fleabag will not waste a second of your time as it encourages you to appreciate how you should love yourself and others. Like the Priest said, “We must choose the right place to put our love.”

526,2023/10/19, 'thursday night football tonight',https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nfl/news/thursday-night-football-time-channel-schedule-week-7/a8587a7617914344116aad7b,"The 2023 version of ""Thursday Night Football"" is continuing on, and the NFL in Week 7 will feature a battle of two teams hoping to win divisional titles this year.

LIVE: Follow Jaguars vs. Saints updates from 'Thursday Night Football'

The Saints are playing host to the Jaguars in the interconference clash. Both teams were favored to win their respective divisions — the NFC South and AFC South — but the Jaguars are the only ones in first place entering Week 7.

Jacksonville sports a 4-2 record that has been buoyed by a three-game winning streak. The Jaguars have a one-game lead on the Colts and the Texans, but with a season sweep of Indianapolis under their belts, they are in the driver's seat.

Meanwhile, New Orleans is sitting at 3-3 and is in third place in the NFC South. That said, the Saints are just a half-game back of the Buccaneers for first place in the division and are only below the Falcons because Atlanta has a better divisional record. So the Derek Carr-led squad isn't far from clawing back to the top of one of the league's most wide-open divisions.

The Saints have lost three of their last four games, so they might be desperate to beat the Jaguars at home on a short week to stay above .500. A loss could damage any confidence Dennis Allen's defense has built and would give the winner of the Buccaneers-Falcons game an upper hand in the divisional race.

Can the Saints' defense do enough to disrupt a Jaguars offense that is starting to find a rhythm? That will be key in deciding who wins what is expected to be a tightly contested Thursday night matchup.

POWER RANKINGS: Where Saints, Jaguars check in among NFL's best teams

Below is everything to know about how to watch the ""Thursday Night Football"" matchup for Week 7 of the 2023 NFL season.

Who plays on Thursday Night Football tonight?

Matchup : Jaguars vs. Saints

: Jaguars vs. Saints Location: Caesars Superdome, New Orleans, La.

The Jaguars will travel to New Orleans to take on the Saints in the Week 7 edition of ""Thursday Night Football.""

Both the Jaguars and Saints entered the 2023 NFL season with the expectations of competing for divisional titles, but Jacksonville got off to a slow start. It was just 1-2 in its first three games and had to cope with a brutal, four-game schedule stretch following its 37-17 loss to the Texans.

That stretch will come to a close against the Saints and thus far during it, the Jaguars are 3-0. They won both of their London contests and managed to beat their divisional rivals, the Colts, a second time despite having been in England for two weeks.

Part of the reason for the Jaguars' success has been their stout run defense, which has rendered teams one-dimensional. That has made its defense more opportunistic.

The Jaguars have nine turnovers forced during their three-game winning streak, and that has given Trevor Lawrence and the offense much easier scoring opportunities. That's part of why they are averaging 28.3 points per game during the winning streak after averaging just 19 in their first three games.

As for the Saints (3-3), they are mired in a bit of a rough patch. They have lost three of their last four games, with the lone exception being a 34-0 thrashing of the hapless Patriots.

The Saints have boasted a strong defense for the majority of the season, but their offense to date has been hit or miss. Excluding its destruction of the Patriots, New Orleans has averaged just 17 points per game and has scored more than 20 points just once. That came in Week 2 against the 0-6 Panthers.

New Orleans will need to take a step forward on offense to compete with what has been a more explosive Jaguars offense in Week 7. That said, given that the Jaguars have such a good run defense, the brunt of the scoring responsibility may be shifted from Alvin Kamara to Derek Carr. That may be a lot to ask of the veteran quarterback given that he hasn't led the Saints to much success against weaker defenses.

So it makes sense that the Jaguars are favored to win this game. The only thing that will be worth watching is whether Lawrence, who suffered a knee injury at the end of the Jaguars' win over the Colts, will be at 100 percent for this contest.

What time is the NFL game tonight?

Date : Thursday, Oct. 19

: Thursday, Oct. 19 Time: 8:15 p.m. ET (7:15 p.m. CT)

The Jaguars vs. Saints game will kick off at 8:15 p.m. ET on Thursday. That will be the regular start time for all of Amazon Prime's ""Thursday Night Football"" games in 2023.

That said, it's worth noting that New Orleans is located in the Central time zone. As such, the game will begin at 7:15 p.m. locally there. The Jaguars are from just one time zone over — the Eastern time zone — so this shouldn't provide the Saints with any sort of notable body clock advantage.

What channel is Thursday Night Football on tonight?

TV channel (Jacksonville) : WJAX (Channel 47)

: WJAX (Channel 47) TV channel (New Orleans) : WDSU (Channel 6)

: WDSU (Channel 6) Live stream: Amazon Prime Video | DAZN (in Canada)

""Thursday Night Football"" will broadcast on Amazon Prime, which is the exclusive home of the program for the next decade. The streaming service signed an 11-year deal with the league prior to the 2022 season to acquire the league's Thursday night package. Thus, those hoping to watch ""TNF"" nationally over the next decade must subscribe to Amazon Prime.

That said, the NFL is taking steps to ensure those in the local area markets of the teams playing on ""Thursday Night Football"" can see the contests without subscriptions. CBS affiliate WJAX (Channel 47) will career the game to those in the Jacksonville area while viewers in the New Orleans market can catch the program on WDSU (Channel 6), an NBC affiliate.

Al Michaels (play-by-play) and Kirk Herbstreit (color commentary) will be on the call for Thursday night's game. The duo, who are in their second season together, will be joined by sidelined reporter Kaylee Hartung and a star-studded studio crew. Charissa Thompson will host the pregame, halftime and postgame coverage and will be joined by a quartet of former players-turned-analysts: Tony Gonzalez, Richard Sherman, Andrew Whitworth and Ryan Fitzpatrick.

Marshawn Lynch will also be a part of Amazon's coverage with his pregame show segment ""N Yo City."" The segment consists of the former Seahawks star performing an activity in or around the host city to show fans what that geographic region is like.

Notably, Lynch's visit to Pennsylvania's Amish country, as broadcast in Week 2, captured the attention of NFL fans everywhere.

“Y’all Amish people think y’all slick, man.”

Lynch's Week 6 trip to the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, along with Pat Mahomes Sr., also drew praise from audiences.

The duo you didn't know you needed.

Viewers in Canada will not have to have Amazon Prime to access ""Thursday Night Football"" in 2023. They will be able to watch the games on DAZN.

NFL live stream for Thursday night game

Live stream: Amazon Prime

Those looking to stream ""Thursday Night Football"" during the 2023 NFL season will need a subscription to Amazon Prime in order to do so. The streaming service will be the exclusive home of the program for the next decade and only those in the participating teams' local markets will be able to access the games using traditional, over-the-air TV broadcasts.

NFL schedule Week 7

The Jaguars and Saints will make for an interesting start to Week 7 of the NFL season, the first week that is set to be majorly impacted by byes. Six teams will have the week off, so just 13 games in total will be played throughout the week.

There is no London game for the first time since NFL Week 3, so the next stand-alone game after ""Thursday Night Football"" will be the ""Sunday Night Football"" clash between the Dolphins and the Eagles. That marquee clash between the two 5-1 teams may temporarily decide which squad holds the ""best team in the NFL"" mantle.

""Monday Night Football"" figures to be another quality matchup as Brock Purdy leads a banged-up 49ers squad against a Vikings team with a solid offense and a hit-or-miss defense. With Justin Jefferson out and both Christian McCaffrey and Deebo Samuel banged up, however, this game may have significantly less star power than the schedule-makers were hoping.

The Sunday schedule highlights include a matchup between the AFC and NFC North leaders, the Ravens and Lions, respectively, and a matchup between the Chiefs and Chargers. The latter matchup has tended to be close in recent seasons as Patrick Mahomes and Justin Herbert have led quality offensive attacks during their respective careers.

Below is the full schedule for Week 7 of the 2023 NFL season.

Shaheen c Labuschagne b Cummins 10 off 8 (Pakistan all out 305) Short, pulled, caught! Australia get the job done – they’re back in business.



20 Oct 2023 12.48 EDT Adam Collins Australia move from 10th to 4th. That’s a pretty good few days, wins against Sri Lanka and Pakistan getting their World Cup campaign on track at last. Their next assignment is the Dutch on Wednesday in Delhi, a game they cannot take lightly after South Africa were caught short by them. As for Pakistan, who registered a couple of wins to begin, they need to get back on the horse right away against rivals Afghanistan at Chennai on Monday after dropping two on the trot. Righto, that’s me done. Thanks for your company and make sure you return to the OBO tomorrow morning for England vs South Africa at the Wankhede. Bye!



20 Oct 2023 12.44 EDT David Warner is player of the match for his 162 Pakistan were in the hunt deep into the chase. But losing their last five wickets for 33, well, that’s the story in a nutshell. Everything must go right to chase 368. Dave Warner joins Simon Doull. To begin, says his groin niggle, which prevented him from fielding, isn’t that serious – some cramping. “I felt like I was a little bit of luck away” from getting into the tournament – and that’s what he got when dropped on 10. But boy, didn’t he make the most of it putting on 259 with Marsh.



20 Oct 2023 12.39 EDT AUSTRALIA WIN BY 62 RUNS! Shaheen c Labuschagne b Cummins 10 off 8 (Pakistan all out 305) Short, pulled, caught! Australia get the job done – they’re back in business.



20 Oct 2023 12.37 EDT 45th over: Pakistan 301-9 (Shaheen 6, Rauf 0) Target 368. Rauf survives. Starc 1/65 from his eight. Can Cummins now finish it off? @collinsadam in the stadium, what an amazing place to watch cricket 🙏 odd chase from Pakistan, they didn't seem to be pressing at all then they weren't suddenly in it, then not so much 🤷 but we also got on Indian TV which was a bonus :) pic.twitter.com/2f8Ssyan6b — davidrelph (@david_relph) October 20, 2023 Best ground in India, imho.



20 Oct 2023 12.34 EDT WICKET! Hasan c Inglis b Starc 8 from 8 (Pakistan 301-9) The streak continues! Hasan jumps across his stumps with a view to popping the left-armer over fine leg but gets an edge instead. Far from Starc’s best night but had he gone wicketless, it would’ve generated several annoying articles about his World Cup streak being over so that’s now put to bed. One wicket to go.



20 Oct 2023 12.31 EDT 44th over: Pakistan 292-8 (Shaheen 1, Hasan 4) Target 368. Hasan Ali is a fighter, he won’t quit here, and that’s shown when picking Hazlewood up over mid-on for four. But he’s just too good when the pressure is on. A bit of chat on telly about Starc never missing out on a wicket in a World Cup game, and he’s on next.



20 Oct 2023 12.27 EDT WICKET! Nawaz st Inglis b Zampa 14 off 16 (Pakistan 287-8) Zampa’s final over includes a Nawaz blast over long on for… SIX! Thinks about doing the same thing again but the wrong’un makes that impossible – a fine response, nearly bowled him. And a carbon copy beats the edge with him strolling, Inglis does the rest! Stumped! Zampa picks up a second four-wicket bag in a row, his return of 4/53 including both Iftikar and Rizwan. Clutch performance. “May I nominate Adam Zampa as the man of the match even now?” asks Sujit A. “Facing all the flak coming into the match, in conditions which could not be more against him, he has been exceptional!” Going to be hard to overlook Warner after 162 but he’s in my votes, that’s for sure. 43rd over: Pakistan 287-8 (Shaheen 0) Target 368.

20 Oct 2023 12.22 EDT 42nd over: Pakistan 274-7 (Nawaz 5, Shaheen 0) Target 368. Hazlewood 9-1-32-1. In terms of economy rate, basically twice as good as the match average. “Hi Adam.” Simon McMahon, good afternoon to you. “From SUPER OVER!!! to just OVER in the blink of an eye. Runs on the board, eh?” Spot on. They had to hold their nerve and have done so pretty well.

20 Oct 2023 12.20 EDT WICKET! Usama c Starc b Hazlewood 0 off 3 (Pakistan 277-7) And that’ll be it. Hazlewood, who has bowled so well, gets his reward via a top edge down to long leg, Starc taking a low catch. Usama’s sorry debut is complete.

Updated at 12.24 EDT

20 Oct 2023 12.18 EDT 41st over: Pakistan 274-6 (Nawaz 2, Usama 0) Target 368. The game-within-a-game is Australia being at least three overs behind their required over rate, which means they need this to be completely iced by over 47 – something like that. But from here, it should be. Zampa’s over brings the wicket but only two runs. Except Pat Cummins, every other bowler for Australia tonight has called the Chinnaswamy Stadium home as an RCB player at some stage. Wonder if all that experience will come in handy at some point #AusvPak #CWC23 — Bharat Sundaresan (@beastieboy07) October 20, 2023



20 Oct 2023 12.15 EDT WICKET! Rizwan lbw b Zampa 46 from 40 (Pakistan 274-6) Umpire’s call is enough for Zampa! The googly again from Zampa, Rizwan misreading and trying to pull, hit on the back thigh and into enough of leg stump. Zampa doing just what he did against Sri Lanka, albeit in much tougher conditions and far greater scoreboard pressure: hitting pads in front of the pegs.

20 Oct 2023 12.13 EDT IS RIZWAN LBW TO ZAMPA TOO? Given out on the field. Up we go again!



20 Oct 2023 12.10 EDT 40th over: Pakistan 272-5 (Rizwan 45, Nawaz 1) Target 368. Hazlewood has been outstanding tonight – 8-1-29-0 his return so far. He gives Pakistan nothing here other than three singles. 96 left in the final ten – if they get it, this will be special.



20 Oct 2023 12.07 EDT 39th over: Pakistan 269-5 (Rizwan 43, Nawaz 0) Target 368. 97 from 66 with Iftikar there feels very different. It pretty much all comes down to Rizwan now.



20 Oct 2023 12.05 EDT WICKET! Iftikar lbw b Zampa 26 from 20 (Pakistan 269-5) The Zampa googly does it! He always has those stumps in play and big Ifti, going back to cut, didn’t get his blade down in time. An easy decision for the TV ump with the ball hitting the back pad first, ball tracking showing it hitting middle.

20 Oct 2023 12.03 EDT HAS ZAMPA TRAPPED IFTIKAR LBW? If it is pad first, Australia will have their man… upstairs we go.

Updated at 12.03 EDT

20 Oct 2023 12.01 EDT 38th over: Pakistan 265-4 (Rizwan 42, Iftikar 23) Target 368. And AGAIN – six more to begin the over! Ifti HAMMERS Stoinis into the sight screen, back over his head. Rizwan, who hasn’t enjoyed much strike of late, does enjoy a shorter ball later in the over, getting down low to pull it over fine leg in unorthodox but effective fashion. 13 off it and 27 from the last two. Zampa’s turn. Fun!



20 Oct 2023 11.56 EDT 37th over: Pakistan 252-4 (Rizwan 37, Iftikar 15) Target 368. Here comes IFTI! One of the cleanest hitters in world cricket, the man who looked like he was 40 since he was 27, launches Cummins for TWO big ones over midwicket into the crowd. That’s their first sixes since over number 14, I’m told by TV – that was how Australia built their score earlier today. But Ifti is the man who can catch up quickly; now the key. If he bats for 40 balls, they’ll be most of the way to 368. Bosh: Flat bat six for Pakistan's Iftikhar Ahmed. Photograph: R Satish Babu/AFP/Getty Images

Updated at 11.59 EDT

20 Oct 2023 11.52 EDT 36th over: Pakistan 238-4 (Rizwan 36, Iftikar 2) Target 368. This is screw-turning time for Australia, before Iftikar can get into his boshing rhythm. Good again from Cummins to get Stoinis back at the right time – six from the over, which works for them at this stage. The required rate is up to 9.3 an over. Cummins has four of the last 14, Starc, Hazlewood and Zampa three each. He’ll also need one more from Stoinis or Maxwell – probably the former on the evidence of his work so far. Cummins STRIKES! ❌

20 Oct 2023 11.48 EDT 35th over: Pakistan 232-4 (Rizwan 34, Iftikar 0) Target 368. Four dots to the big-hitting Ifti after the Skakeel wicket; that’s a huuuge over from the skipper.



20 Oct 2023 11.44 EDT WICKET! Shakeel c Stoinis b Cummins 30 from 31 (Pakistan 232-4) The Cricket Ground DJ brings on Australian classic, The Easybeats - Friday On My Mind, as Marcus Stoinis drags in a critical catch. It’s the captain Cummins, back for a third spell, who locates a top edge from the left-hander Shakeel, an attempted pull spitting out to cover, Stoinis holding his nerve running back with the flight.

Updated at 12.12 EDT

20 Oct 2023 11.41 EDT 34th over: Pakistan 231-3 (Rizwan 33, Shakeel 30) Target 368. More Maxwell, who has two jobs: get through without going around and get through quickly. A reminder that as soon as the cut-off time is met, Australia will have to bring a fifth fielder inside the circle at the death. And as it was in his previous over, it starts well before Shakeel lines him up, pulling from back of a length over midwicket – his fifth boundary. The required rate is 8.6 an over… they’re a big chance here.



20 Oct 2023 11.38 EDT 33rd over: Pakistan 222-3 (Rizwan 29, Shakeel 25) Target 368. Mid-off and mid-on are inside the circle for Starc v Shakeel, which means, as Shane Watson reinforces on TV, they’re going to be banging it in. But mindful of this too, it means the left-hander can camp on the back foot and wait, doing this perfectly from the third ball of the over, pulling over wide mid-on for four. Sensible batting again. Starc gets away with one later on, a bouncer that should surely be called a wide for height but isn’t – how’s he gotten away with that? “I concur,” agrees Watto, “that looked high.” Ohh, more brilliance from Shakeel to finish, predicting Starc’s full ball at the pegs, jumping across his stumps before shovelling it over his right shoulder – four more! Australia are only a couple of wickets away from turning the screws but these two are doing a super job so far with their stand worth 47.

Updated at 11.39 EDT

20 Oct 2023 11.33 EDT 32nd over: Pakistan 213-3 (Rizwan 29, Shakeel 17) Target 368. Another factor: Australia are three overs behind their required rate, which means they will, at some stage, have a fielder moved back inside the circle. Remember Starc’s eight-minute over at the start? Anyway, that prompts the return of Maxwell who is sprinting back to his mark after every ball in an effort to sneak this through inside 90 seconds. And it goes nicely until the final ball, just one single from five to that point, but Rizwan won’t let the off-spinner dictate terms so he charges down the track and pops the ball over mid-off man, who is inside the ring, for four. Clever.



20 Oct 2023 11.30 EDT 31st over: Pakistan 208-3 (Rizwan 25, Shakeel 16) Target 368. Teams are so well-drilled now that this scenario – thinking of the time left as a T20 – is something Cummins and co would’ve played out before the tournament. But the same applies for Pakistan. With Starc to deal with, short of his best so far here, Rizwan breaks the run of singles with a fierce pull across the line to make the most of the round-the-wicket angle. He looks bang up for this. 160 from 114 needed.



20 Oct 2023 11.26 EDT 30th over: Pakistan 200-3 (Rizwan 19, Shakeel 14) Target 368. Back from drinks and his concussion Test, Shakeel lifts Hazlewood over mid-on for four. That’s a beautiful shot – hold the pose. Shakeel isn’t one of Pakistan’s more high-profile stars but he’s looking good and has to score heavily and quickly from here.



20 Oct 2023 11.20 EDT 29.4 overs: Pakistan 196-3 (Rizwan 19, Shakeel 10) Target 368. Bouncer, four. Shakeel didn’t know where that was going but over the ‘keeper is safe enough. Oh, that hit the helmet not the bat so the umpires have called for both a concussion test and the drinks break. The required run rate is 8.5. Manageable.



20 Oct 2023 11.17 EDT 29th over: Pakistan 190-3 (Rizwan 18, Shakeel 10) Target 368. As it has been throughout the chase, whenever Pakistan need a good over they seem to get one with nine runs off Zampa. Shakeel has the only boundary, tucking Zampa fine of the man on the edge of the circle – they need the left-hander to fly tonight. “Afternoon Adam.” Brian Withington! Great to hear from you. “Although it feels like Pat Cummins just held the catch that wins this game, let’s hope it’s at least a close one - I’ve not done any numbers but I’m guessing this has been a particularly one-sided start to the competition in historical terms?” Not wrong. The closest finish was Pakistan’s chase over Sri Lanka? And that was wrapped up at least a couple of overs before the end for a comfortable win.



20 Oct 2023 11.13 EDT 28th over: Pakistan 181-3 (Rizwan 16, Shakeel 3) Target 368. Huge shout for leg before… not out. Looks to be pitching just outside leg so the new bowler, Hazlewood, doesn’t encourage Cummins to review it. After three dots – remember how many of those the opening bowler sent down in his first spell – Shakeel gets a single. We get a DRS projection of the lbw appeal and it was pitching in-line with leg stump but it was going over the pegs. Two singles; spot on. He has 0/20 from six – the tidiest bowler on show from either side in this high-scoring affair.



20 Oct 2023 11.06 EDT 27th over: Pakistan 179-3 (Rizwan 15, Shakeel 2) Target 368. Replay after replay of Cummins’ dive. As Ian Bishop says on comms, this is the guy bowling down the other end and having to make all the decisions – had to be switched on to his job in there at midwicket and was. Five from the over and the massive Babar wicket. “Australia should WIN!” says Justin Christopher. With Babar gone, they must. 𝗣𝗔𝗥𝗧𝗡𝗘𝗥𝗦𝗛𝗜𝗣 𝗕𝗥𝗢𝗞𝗘𝗡! ❌

20 Oct 2023 11.03 EDT WCKET! Babar c Cummins b Zampa 18 off 14 (Pakistan 175-3) Brilliant from Cummins! He catches his opposite number with a dive to his right at midwicket. He’s nailed his bowling change there too, getting Zampa straight back on after the two wickets from Stoinis and it’s paid off two balls later. A huge moment, seeing the back of Babar, who looked in sparkling touch from the get-go. Australia's Adam Zampa celebrates after taking the wicket of Pakistan's captain Babar Azam.

20 Oct 2023 11.01 EDT 26th over: Pakistan 174-2 (Babar 18, Rizwan 13) Target 368. The quieter over Australia were after, five singles off Stoinis. Zampa and Maxwell, when they go back to their spinners? Big decisions to come for the captain Cummins.



20 Oct 2023 10.59 EDT 25th over: Pakistan 169-2 (Babar 16, Rizwan 11) Target 368. Rizwan’s turn! The new man has form against Australia. I was lucky enough to be at Karachi commentating on the enthralling Test there last year where Babar batted for two days for the better part of 200 then Rizwan hit a three-hour ton to nearly haul down 500-odd before securing the draw. Wild scenes. With Cummins back on, the wicketkeeper-bat is straight into him with a delicate cut for four before thumping a slap past mid off for a second boundary. Ten off it. At the halfway mark, Pakistan need to go at eight an over, which is about right from their perspective.



20 Oct 2023 10.56 EDT 24th over: Pakistan 159-2 (Babar 16, Rizwan 1) Target 368. Just as it was in the previous successful Stoinis over, it’s capped with a beautiful Babar boundary, turned through the legside from the off-stump line. He’s so good.



20 Oct 2023 10.49 EDT WICKET! Imam c Starc b Stoinis 70 off 71 (Pakistan 154-2) Stoinis pumps his arms in celebration for a second time in two overs! Imam has done just about everything right until this point, but the upper cut he was committed to doesn’t clear Starc on the third man rope – a safe low catch is snaffled, and a crucial one at that. That was loaded with risk with the man back. Marcus Stoinis of Australia celebrates the wicket of Imam-ul-Haq. Photograph: Robert Cianflone/Getty Images

Updated at 10.50 EDT

20 Oct 2023 10.46 EDT 23rd over: Pakistan 151-1 (Imam 69, Babar 10) Target 368. The balance of Starc’s overs will be used carefully, maybe across two further spells after this. His fifth over begins here with Imam placing a single behind point. Later in the set, one sneaks past Babar’s inside edge with a tiny touch of movement. But not just content with singles, Imam ends the over with a ferocious pull over midwicket to bring up Pakistan’s 150! He made room, giving Starc his stumps to aim at, but when it was banged in he was able to free the arms and give it everything. Australia were 169-0 at this point but they didn’t finish that well. Great stuff. “Hi Adam, enjoying the OBO as per usual.” Thank you, Tom Barrington. “Is this the first game that we’ve seen where both sides have maintained a strong attacking intent after the powerplay during the middle overs? Is it the conditions or because both teams need the win desperately? Aided by bad fielding? Great to see Pakistan keeping their foot down after a period of consolidation.” And because of it, we are some chance of seeing our first close finish of the comp!



20 Oct 2023 10.41 EDT 22nd over: Pakistan 143-1 (Imam 63, Babar 8) Target 368. Pakistan’s middle-overs master, Babar Azam, walks to the middle boasting an average of 75 against Australia in ODIs. And whaddayaknow, he begins here with a controlled and well-placed pull – a boundary second ball. And another, flicking out in the same direction off the front foot – fine timing. Eventful over, the wicket also coming.



20 Oct 2023 10.36 EDT WICKET! Shafique c Maxwell b Stoinis 64 off 61 (Pakistan 134-1) And they do get something! Via the big right arm of Stoinis, who strikes with his first ball of the night. Banged in, top edge, goes nowhere – Maxwell takes the easy chance. The Cricket Ground DJ plays Working Class Man. They’re away… at last.



20 Oct 2023 10.33 EDT 21st over: Pakistan 134-0 (Shafique 64, Imam 63) Target 368. Starc is back but… the ball isn’t hooping, at all. He can be expensive at his pace. But not here – three singles, which Australia will take at this point. They really need something soon. Really enjoyed this from Ewan Glenton on Zaheer Abbas, who Geoff Lemon and I regularly talk about on The Final Word Podcast on our weekend history show! When Rassie van der Dussen reached 2000 ODI runs last week, I saw the list of the quickest batters to reach that milestone, headed by Amla (40 innings), then after him, all in 45 knocks, VDR, Kevin Pietersen, Babar Azam and Zaheer Abbas. Checking out Zaheer’s stats compared to his contemporaries (so early 70s to mid-80s) it stands out that he had an ODI strike rate of 85, which is comparable to the likes of Root & Smith nowadays (both 87), and though they’re not super express scorers they’re generally considered quick enough and aptly suited to the modern game, I think. Well, going that far back, unless I’m overlooking someone you’ll find nobody among elite batsmen who exceeded that except the inevitable Viv Richards (SR 90), and I can only find one (Clive Lloyd, 81) who even gets close. Most of the macho bat-swinging all-rounders of the time (Hadlee, Botham, Imran) were way, way behind, with only Kapil Dev (a stonking 95) standing up to comparison. Standout ODI performers of the time (Alan Lamb, Gordon Greenidge, Martin Crowe, Robin Smith…) are also far behind, with SRs in the 60s & 70s. Then fast forward a generation or two and you’ll find even Ponting, Hayden, Brian Lara, all much slower; Tendulkar’s was similar at 86, as was Pietersen’s (also 86, and I think even by modern standards KP’s hardly looked upon as a slouch, right?). So basically I think Pakistan can claim that Zaheer (who interestingly had a higher average in ODIs (48) than in tests (45) which was extremely rare too) is the only “elite” batsman, together with Richards, who was playing a good modern ODI game 30 to 40 years ahead of his time. Just wanted to quickly get that tribute in and say kudos to Zaheer, to give Pakistan fans something to smile and wave their arms about before they (however valiantly it turns out to be) lose this match.



20 Oct 2023 10.29 EDT 20th over: Pakistan 131-0 (Shafique 62, Imam 62) Target 368. That’s a big over for Pakistan sticking it to Maxwell. He’s really not done anything wrong there but 15 runs are taken through enterprising, clever batting. Shafique begins by making room and lifting over point – it’s a messy stroke but there’s nobody out there; a calculated risk. Next, a dance down the track then a thump past the bowler in his follow-through – beautiful to watch. Imam’s turn comes later the over, also using his feet before lifting over extra cover. Both openers are in and making smart decisions. 72 runs were added in the second ten overs after 59 in the first.



20 Oct 2023 10.25 EDT 19th over: Pakistan 116-0 (Shafique 53, Imam 56) Target 368. My sense is that Zampa’s remaining overs will be vital in the final analysis of this game. He’s been much better to begin than in the first three games, conceding 24 runs across his first five overs but he has the stumps in play throughout – not easy as a leggie.



20 Oct 2023 10.24 EDT Shafique and Imam both raises their 50s 18th over: Pakistan 112-0 (Shafique 51, Imam 54) Target 368. To long on to begin, and that’s Shafique to 50 in 50 balls. He had that chance, put down by the sub Sean Abbott at backward square, but a fine innings. Oh, now another DROPPED CATCH and this time it’s the captain. Inside the circle at midwicket, Imam pulls hard enough to burst through his hands. Maxwell’s frustration grows later in the over when the left-hander tickles him fine of the man at the 45 before running down for four. That’s his eighth boundary and brings up his half-century too. That’s his fifth consecutive 50-plus score in ODIs v Australia (thanks again, TV). Pakistan's Imam-ul-Haq (L) is congratulated by his teammate Abdullah Shafique after scoring a half-century.

20 Oct 2023 10.19 EDT 17th over: Pakistan 104-0 (Shafique 49, Imam 48) Target 368. Singles and dots against Zampa until the final ball when the legspinner drops short enough to prompt Imam to go back and cut behind point – he gets four for that. The 100-run stand is also up, the first for Pakistan in World Cups since 2015, the TV tells me.



20 Oct 2023 10.14 EDT 16th over: Pakistan 97-0 (Shafique 47, Imam 43) Target 368. Maxwell after the drink and he’s straight on it – hasn’t put a foot wrong with the ball since his return from injury just before the tournament. Three singles off. Interesting – the umpire has just told both teams there is no DRS for the time being with Simon Doull adding that there’s been a power outage. Pressure on the men in the middle. Not sure if Mitch Marsh’s shoelace-tying skills are world-renowned but Abdullah Shafique made sure he bypassed a few other Aussie players & the umpire to make sure he had his laces done up by Marsh #AusvPak #CWC23 — Bharat Sundaresan (@beastieboy07) October 20, 2023



20 Oct 2023 10.07 EDT 15th over: Pakistan 94-0 (Shafique 45, Imam 42) Target 368. Cummins ensures that it’s only singles from Zampa when throwing himself across the turf at midwicket to save a couple. The leggie isn’t far away with a leading edge to finish but there’s nobody at catching cover – understandably at this stage. Drinks! Shaheen Shah Afridi has taken 25 wickets from just 9 games in World Cups.

20 Oct 2023 10.05 EDT 14th over: Pakistan 90-0 (Shafique 43, Imam 40) Target 368. BANG! “That’s making a statement to Pat Cummins!” says Shane Watson in relation to Shafique’s powerful pull over midwicket to finish the over. The plan is to bounce the opener out as the Australian captain nearly did in his previous over with the dropped catch but he had all the time in the world there, eventually given as a SIX by the TV umpire – the first big one of Pakistan’s chase. The required rate from here until the end is 7.7 and they’re currently going at 6.4 – very good going.

There is a thing called real estate porn. After salivating over the wonderful dens of the assorted media stars in The Morning Show, here is another bunch of exquisite living quarters to pamper your peepers. And when you realise that one of the homes is shared by college students, you would need to take a break to pick your jaw off the floor.

The Other Zoey Director: Sara Zandieh Cast: Josephine Langford, Drew Starkey, Archie Renaux, Mallori Johnson, Patrick Fabian, Heather Graham, Andie MacDowell Story line: A computer nerd who does not believe in romantic love has to do a rethink when it hits her in the face Run time: 91 minutes

The Other Zoey is the kind of pasta-vanilla rom-com that is as sweet and comforting as fried, sugar-dusted bread. From the time Zoey (Josephine Langford) pitches her app to match compatible people instead of looking for romantic love, at a history class during a presentation on Valentine’s Day, we know she is headed for a jolly comeuppance.

Zoey is a high-achieving computer geek who has her future all mapped out, set to soar to the stratosphere on the back of degrees at MIT. She believes that romantic love is a commercial construct and relationships built on compatibility have a better chance of surviving. Her flatmate, Elle (Mallori Johnson) is the exact opposite of Zoey, enjoying watching rom-coms, weeping in sympathy as Julia Roberts tells Hugh Grant, she is “just a girl...”, writing poems and studying creative writing.

When Zoey hears Miles (Archie Renaux), who is a student at MIT, quote philosopher Alain de Botton about romantic love being a modern-day invention and that people would not fall in love if they had not heard of it, she feels she has found her perfect match. Complications arise when she causes soccer star Zach (Drew Starkey) to have a concussion and amnesia.

Zach mistakes Zoey for his girlfriend, who is also called Zoey (Maggie Thurmon), and the doctor, in the true tradition of Hindi film doctors from the ‘70s says, Zach should be kept calm, without any stress or his brain will be forever broken. Just as Zoey is getting ready to tell Zach’s charming parents Connie (Andie MacDowell) and Matt (Patrick Fabian), the truth, Miles walks into the lovely house and Zoey decides to hold her peace.

The family, with Miles and Zach’s precocious little sister, Avery (Olive Abercrombie) are heading out for a ski weekend and invite Zoey along. With solid advice from Elle (“less books, more bathing suits”) Zoey joins the party. The truth will out and there is a falling out among best friends, but all comes right in the requisite grand gesture with a live stream replacing the boom box.

The leads are pleasant, their romance and sparring cheery, and it is so nice to see Heather Graham and Andie MacDowell be the best kind of movie mums. There are no cupcakes or cakes of any kind for that matter, but there is pizza that looks yummy, chess and much pop music; all coming together to pass an agreeable 90 minutes. Incidentally, science fiction and romance are not mutually exclusive, whatever Elle might say.

Michigan and coach Jim Harbaugh are being investigated by the NCAA for the second time this year.

A low-level staffer with a military background has emerged as one of the linchpins of the NCAA investigation into the University of Michigan's alleged sign-stealing operation, sources told ESPN on Thursday.

Harbaugh has already served a university-imposed three-game suspension this season stemming from alleged recruiting violations during the COVID-19 dead period and for not cooperating with NCAA investigators.

Here are a few answers to questions based on what we know about the developing investigation.

What is Michigan accused of doing?

The NCAA notified Michigan officials and the Big Ten Conference on Wednesday that it is investigating allegations that the Wolverines were stealing signs. According to a report from Yahoo, Michigan allegedly had people attending future opponents' games -- as well as those of potential College Football Playoff opponents -- to gather information about the teams' signals for offensive and defensive plays that are sent from the sideline. The NCAA's investigation also includes games prior to the 2022 season, sources told ESPN.

If the Wolverines sent people to games to steal signs, it would violate NCAA Bylaw 11.6.1, which states: ""Off-campus, in-person scouting of future opponents (in the same season) is prohibited."" There aren't a lot of details available, including how much, if any, head coach Jim Harbaugh knew about the sign stealing; how many games someone associated with Michigan attended; how long the alleged sign-stealing system has been used; what staff members, if any, attended future opponents' games; and if electronic devices were used to record the signals.

Who is Connor Stalions?

Stalions is a person of interest in the NCAA's investigation, sources told ESPN. He has worked as an off-field analyst for the Wolverines since May 2022. According to his LinkedIn account, he was previously a volunteer coach at Michigan from 2015 to 2022.

The son of two Michigan alumni, Stalions attended the United States Naval Academy, where he was a student assistant on the football team. After being commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Marine Corps in 2017, Stalions worked as a graduate assistant at Navy before beginning his military training, according to his LinkedIn account.

Stalions wrote on LinkedIn that he attempts to ""employ Marine Corps philosophies and tactics into the sport of football regarding strategies in staffing, recruiting, scouting, intelligence, planning and more.""

Among the skills Stalions wrote about on LinkedIn were ""identifying the opponent's most likely course of action and most dangerous course of action"" and ""identifying and exploiting critical vulnerabilities and centers of gravity in the opponent scouting process.""

Why is in-person scouting banned in college sports?

Sign stealing is technically not against NCAA rules and is a practice that has gone on with a wink-wink for decades. Scouting opponents in person was outlawed by the NCAA in 1994 as a cost-cutting measure.

The rule change eliminated all live scouting by staff members or scouting services, which was a big change for football and men's and women's basketball. University presidents believed it was just as easy for coaches to scout opponents on TV or tape. They also hoped it would bring more equity to the playing field because schools with smaller athletics budgets couldn't afford to send their coaches all over the country on scouting trips like the big schools did.

Many coaches were upset when in-person scouting was banned nearly three decades ago, especially those from smaller schools who couldn't watch their opponents' games on TV. But coaches adjusted by swapping tapes of recent games. Coaches complained that they couldn't gauge an opponents' speed on tape or pick up details like cadence and tendencies without seeing them live.

How does college football send in its plays?

College football doesn't use one-way helmet communications like the NFL does, so teams assign players and other sideline personnel to signal in plays. Teams usually have multiple signalers -- only one who communicates the correct plays -- to limit sign stealing. They also use large placards, often divided into four squares, that display logos, symbols and pictures of celebrities and pop culture references to identify certain plays. Some play sequences at the beginning of each half are scripted, so players know the general sequence of what will be called.

Why doesn't college football use radio communication like the NFL?

Despite increasing support among coaches for helmet communications, college football has held off, namely because of cost but also some liability concerns. The vastly different budgets of leagues and teams would make helmet communication technology a financial challenge for the less-resourced programs throughout the sport. Steve Shaw, the national coordinator of officials, told The Athletic in 2022 that any change to helmets could void liability and warranty language, which then could open potential lawsuits for head injuries. ""The long pole in the tent on this is getting the helmet authorization from the manufacturers and making sure they meet all standards and are totally supportive,"" Shaw said.

One Power 5 coach told ESPN on Thursday, ""Sign stealing is a huge issue in college football that no one talks about. It's the easiest thing to fix. There are wearable devices. It's embarrassing to watch college football and see all the lengths people go to to hide signals. It's a bad look.""

What would this mean for Michigan and Jim Harbaugh given he's already under investigation by the NCAA?

Harbaugh already faces NCAA charges of failure to cooperate and head coach responsibility related to recruiting violations committed during the COVID-19 dead period. Another violation by a member of his coaching staff could trigger another charge of head coach responsibility, which could potentially be a Level I violation. According to NCAA bylaw 19.12.5.1: ""An institution shall be considered a repeat violator if the Committee on Infractions finds that a Level I or Level II violation has occurred within five years of the starting date of a Level I or Level II penalty stemming from a previous case."" Because the NCAA has not ruled on Michigan's Level II violations case, stemming from alleged recruiting infractions during the COVID-19 dead period, the school and potentially Harbaugh could be deemed repeat violators.

The NCAA Committee on Infractions rejected a four-game negotiated suspension for Harbaugh in the recruiting case, and Michigan self-imposed a three-game suspension. With that case still needing to be resolved, an additional head coach responsibility charge based on alleged signal stealing would significantly increase his exposure to additional punishment, including a longer suspension.

The NCAA's committee on infractions would not need to render its decision on the initial case for the repeat violator provision to be enacted. The infractions committee is not expected to make its decision on the first case until 2024.

Will Michigan have to forfeit games if found guilty?

The retroactive vacation of wins is always possible in major infractions cases. Sources told ESPN that the NCAA is investigating allegations that stem from before the 2023 season, so impacted games that Michigan won could be vacated. Other possible penalties include postseason bans, scholarship reductions, fines and coaching restrictions (game suspensions and off-campus recruiting privileges) for those who are implicated.

Is there precedent for sign-stealing accusations like this in college football?

Some coaches have been more tolerant of sign stealing than others. As Clemson's longtime defensive coordinator, Oklahoma coach Brent Venables earned the reputation of being one of the best at stealing signs during games.

Before the Tigers played Ohio State in a College Football Playoff semifinal at the Sugar Bowl on New Year's Day in 2021, Buckeyes coach Ryan Day said, ""He's one of the best defensive coordinators in college football. He does a great job calling the game. Seems to always know exactly what the other team is doing in terms of the plays that they're running, each play. Seems to call the right defense into that play a lot. Why that is, I don't really know, but I can tell you he's been doing it for a really long time and it's a good challenge.""

In 2015, Washington State coach Mike Leach, who was never one to mince his words, accused Arizona State of stealing signs. He doubled down before the teams met the next year.

""I think they still steal signs,"" Leach said. ""We'll have to keep an eye on it. That's certainly the reputation. And I think they have a certain amount of technology and expertise on the subject which if they ever go to a different conference or something I'd certainly like them to share it with us.

""But yeah, you've got to keep an eye on it because they'll steal signs and they're pretty clever about it. And it's like breaking the enigma code with them. ... I think they ought to do a full on investigation to see how they're doing it and make sure it's within the rules.""

Then Arizona State coach Todd Graham even admitted as much.

""We are definitely going by the rules,"" Graham said. ""There's not anything illegal about looking at somebody's signals or somebody's groupings.""

In 2016, then-Baylor assistant coach Jeff Lebby was suspended for a half for being on the sideline at a Tulsa-Oklahoma game. Lebby was in Tulsa, Oklahoma, to attend a wedding, and he and his wife had been invited to the game. Someone spotted him on the Golden Hurricane sideline and told him he wasn't supposed to be there under NCAA rules, and Lebby left. He missed the first half of Baylor's game against Oklahoma that season.

533,2023/10/21, 'alabama vs tennessee',https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap/_/gameId/401520333,"Paul Finebaum breaks down how Alabama has recovered from its loss to Texas and gotten back into playoff contention.

TUSCALOOSA, Ala. -- — Alabama players surged back onto the field happily puffing on celebratory cigars.

The 11th-ranked Crimson Tide had plenty to celebrate minutes after producing an utterly dominant second half to keep their national championship hopes from going up in smoke.

Jalen Milroe passed for two touchdowns, Jihaad Campbell returned a fumble for a score in the fourth quarter and Alabama uncorked 27 straight second-half points in rallying for a 34-20 victory over No. 17 Tennessee on Saturday.

“Obviously a pretty fun second half,” Tide coach Nick Saban said.

With its national title hopes on the brink, Alabama (7-1, 5-0 Southeastern Conference) turned in its most dominant half of the season. And it came against a border rival who had helped end ‘Bama’s championship aspirations a year ago.

“This is the reason you come to college football to play in games like this,” Milroe said. “To have moments like this that you will remember forever.”

Cigar smoke wafted across Bryant-Denny Stadium in the aftermath, a long-standing tradition for the winner in this rivalry. Some players raced across the field to celebrate with the student section, and Saban made a beeline that way too.

The comeback was fueled by big plays from Milroe and tailback Jase McClellan and a defense that smothered Joe Milton III and the Volunteers (5-2, 2-2) after the half and even provided the decisive TD.

Saban said his halftime message was, “Everybody’s got to choose what they want.""

""And we went out and scored in two plays in the second half of the first drive and changed the momentum of the game and played really well from that time on,” he said.

Cambell took a scoop-and-score 24 yards midway through the fourth quarter after Chris Braswell knocked the ball loose from Milton.

The loss dealt a big blow to the SEC East chances for the Vols, who had built a 20-7 halftime lead with a huge start from Milton.

Their chances of a first win in Tuscaloosa in 20 years rapidly evaporated. The Vols had ended 15 years of frustration against the Tide, 52-49 a year ago on a last-play field goal.

Alabama got payback in the final 30 minutes of the rematch.

“It was personal,” Braswell said. “It was a personal game to us.”

Milroe completed 14 of 21 passes for 220 yards, with a 46-yard touchdown less than a minute into the second half and an earlier 10-yarder to Jermaine Burton. McClellan ran 27 times for 115 yards and a touchdown.

Milton was 28 of 41 for 271 yards — including 175 by the half — and two touchdowns. He also gained 59 rushing after completing his first nine passes.

Alabama turned Vols coach Josh Heupel's second failed fourth-down gamble shy of midfield territory into its first lead. McClellan bounced outside and ran untouched for a 5-yard touchdown.

The Tide had a chance to make it a two-score game in the fourth quarter but had to settle for Will Reichard's 50-yard field goal for a 27-20 lead with 8:17 left. The defense delivered the knockout blow.

Squirrel Wright sprawled out for a 39-yard touchdown on the opening drive and finished with 10 catches for 111 yards. He had eight for 105 by halftime, though.

Tennessee linebacker Elijah Herring said the Vols lost “that get it done mentality” in the second half.

“We just let go of that rope, felt comfortable, felt like we won the game already,” Herring said.

THE TAKEAWAY

Tennessee: The Vols looked like a different offense in the first half, keeping the Tide off-balance. Milton turned things around after Texas A&M held him to 100 passing yards. Heupel's fourth-down gambles and failures in the red zone cost the team.

“I felt like we had an opportunity to pick it up and obviously didn’t,” Heupel said of the gambles. “We gave them a short field and they took advantage of it.”

Alabama: Yet another slow start left Alabama down 13-0 and outgained 187-36 in the first quarter. The Tide looked like a completely different team in the second half, though. It was a big bounce-back from second-half struggles against Arkansas. Saban said cornerback Terrion Arnold suffered “a slight concussion.”

POLL IMPLICATIONS

Alabama could well return to the Top 10 for the first time since losing to Texas — unless voters only saw the first half. The Vols won't likely fall too far.

PENALTIES

Alabama committed 17 penalties for 130 yards in last year's loss to Tennessee. The Tide was flagged only once for 5 yards in the rematch.

534,2023/10/21, 'ohio state vs penn state',https://www.espn.com/college-football/recap/_/gameId/401520343,"Ryan Day talks about the pivotal role Ohio State's defense played in the team's win vs. Penn State.

COLUMBUS, Ohio -- — All-American Marvin Harrison Jr. made the difference for No. 3 Ohio State in a pivotal Big Ten matchup — and the snarling Buckeyes' defense took care of the rest.

Harrison made 11 catches for 162 yards and a late touchdown as Ohio State beat No. 7 Penn State 20-12 on Saturday. The Buckeyes' defense smothered Drew Allar and the Nittany Lions (6-1, 3-1 Big Ten), extending Ohio State's winning streak in the series to seven games.

Penn State needed 58 minutes to convert a third or fourth down and didn't get into the end zone until 29 seconds were left in the game. Penn State failed to convert on its first 15 third-down attempts.

Kyle McCord was 22 for 35 for 286 yards and the Buckeyes (7-0, 4-0) put up 367 total yards, a season-high against Penn State's stingy defense.

“I’m not sure if we didn’t just watch the two of the best teams in college football, specifically on the defensive side of the ball,"" Penn State coach James Franklin said.

He added: “The story of the game came down to third down. We weren’t able to stay on the field, which was the biggest difference in the game.”

The biggest moment for Penn State was fleeting.

Nittany Lions linebacker Curtis Jacobs stunned the Ohio Stadium crowd in the first half when he knocked the ball loose from McCord, scooped up the fumble and galloped 60 yards the other way for an apparent touchdown. However, the play was nullified because of defensive holding penalty.

Five plays later, Miyan Willams plunged in from 2 yards out to give the Buckeyes the lead. Williams had 56 of Ohio State's 79 rushing yards, an average of fewer than 2 yards per carry.

Harrison was the one reliable offensive weapon for either team. He caught a pass crossing the middle and went 18 yards for a score that made it 20-6 with 4:07 left.

“I think most teams, the first thing they look at is how to take away Marvin Harrison,"" Ohio State coach Ryan Day said. ""I think we targeted him 16 times, and he was open on most of those plays. He showed up in a big spot today again. I haven’t seen everybody play across the country, but it would be hard for me to find somebody who’s better in the country. I don’t know how he gets on these lists or doesn’t get on these lists, but to me he’s one of the most special players in the country.”

The Nittany Lions managed only field goals of 40 and 41 yards from Alex Felkins in the first half and were shut out in the second until Allar found Kaden Saunders for an 8-yard TD in the final 30 seconds.

The Buckeyes sacked Allar four times.

“It sucks to lose like this — especially on the road,” Allar said. “(They're) a really good team.”

THE TAKEWAY

Penn State: The Nittany Lions came in with the top defense in the nation. The unit bent and finally broke, unable to contain Harrison. The offense never got on track against the Buckeyes, gaining only 49 rushing yards.

Ohio State: The Buckeyes defense was outstanding, and it was good thing on a day when the offense stumbled for much of the day. Defensive end J.T. Tuimoloau, who had one of the best defensive games in Ohio State history last year against Penn State, was a force again against the Nittany Lions.

HARD GOING

Ohio State again had trouble running the ball and keeps looking for solutions. Williams got his first significant playing time of the season, rushing for 70 yards but only an averaging 2.6 per carry. The No. 1 back, TreVeyon Henderson, was listed as questionable but was held out again with a injury.

“If we want to take the next step as a team, we’re going to have to figure that part out,"" Day said.

MORE MARV

Harrison is the first Ohio State receiver to have five career games with at least 160 receiving yards. David Boston (1996-98) had four.

“I’m just doing my job, really,” Harrison said. “Out there on the field, I’m not really realizing what I’m doing. The ball comes my way, I want to make a play for my teammates.”

INJURIES

Penn State defensive end Chop Robinson was carted to the locker room in the first half after taking what appeared to be a hard hit to the head. Robinson stayed down on the field for several minutes and finally was able to walk off with help. He went straight from the medical tent to the locker room.

Ohio State quarterback Devin Brown was hurt when he came on run the ball at the Penn State 6.

POLL IMPLICATIONS

After winning the top-10 matchup, the Buckeyes should at least stay put Sunday. Penn State likely will drop.

LONDON -- The landmark victory Mauricio Pochettino needs to kickstart his Chelsea career still eludes him. Arsenal showed great resilience in battling back to earn a 2-2 draw at Stamford Bridge on Saturday, but Pochettino was left to rue his team throwing away a golden opportunity to secure the sort of result that could have been an important building block in their evolution.

Arteta spoke glowingly this week about how Pochettino taught him so much during their playing days together at Paris Saint-Germain, and for a long time at Stamford Bridge this appeared to be something approaching a lesson in management from the Argentine.

Pochettino surprised his opposite number by starting Cole Palmer as a false nine. Out of possession, Palmer and Conor Gallagher tirelessly led Chelsea's press, forcing the visitors into uncharacteristic errors which had Arteta fuming on the touchline.

Arteta is hardly a shrinking violet in the dugout, but his ire is usually saved for the match officials rather than his own players, and so it was noticeable from the outset how frustrated he had become with a combination of Chelsea's fast start and his own team's slovenly behaviour.

""What went wrong was the start of the game,"" said Arteta. ""We didn't play with enough purpose and clarity. We were just moving the ball without the intention to threaten them. That's a really dangerous thing to do against teams like Chelsea. Then we didn't win enough duels, and in tight areas when we had them they escaped from that and they attacked open spaces and they are really dangerous things to do.""

The Blues were good value for their 2-0 lead even if both goals were fortuitous. William Saliba was adjudged to have handed Mykhailo Mudryk's header despite the ball hitting him from point-blank range. Arteta took his protestations to the final whistle -- after which he was booked by referee Chris Kavanagh -- but Palmer stroked home the resulting penalty with consummate ease before Mudryk impacted the game again three minutes after half-time.

The Ukrainian winger appeared to attempt a cross from the left flank which looped over David Raya and landed into the net. Afterward, Mudryk claimed goalkeeping coach Tony Jimenez had told him to try to exploit Raya's positioning off his line from such angles, but it nevertheless appeared a moment of fortune.

Whatever the truth, Mudryk now has his first home goal and a moment which can help his individual development, coming against the team who also tried to buy him from Shakhtar Donetsk back in January.

That narrative led to a degree of schadenfreude among home supporters, but it was the Gunners who had the last laugh here. Chelsea had done an excellent job of nullifying Martin Odegaard collectively and Bukayo Saka individually, the latter marshalled superbly by Marc Cucurella in what must surely rank as one of his best games for the club. But all that was undermined by a poor mistake from Blues goalkeeper Robert Sánchez, gifting the ball to Rice, who still had plenty to do but finished smartly into the vacated net to trigger a comeback.

In a measure of how blunted they had been all afternoon, Rice's goal was Arsenal's first shot on target, coming in the 77th minute. Saka finally freed himself from Cucurella to cross for substitute Leandro Trossard to equalise, leaving Pochettino to reflect on an incomplete team performance.

""We were very competitive but we are disappointed because in the end we lose two points,"" said Pochettino. ""Until 77 minutes when we conceded the first goal. We didn't concede too many chances.

""I think 90% of goals are because an opponent makes a mistake. We can only criticise [the players] a little bit in reading better the tempo, the timing. We can take risks because it's our philosophy but make better decisions,"" added Pochettino.

Arsenal found a way past Manchester City prior to the international break with a reshuffled midfield featuring Jorginho and Rice anchoring a midfield in a system approximating 4-2-3-1, attempting to sacrifice a degree of creativity for stability, but it was not convincing in that aim here. Oleksandr Zinchenko was taken off at half-time after a torrid 45 minutes against Raheem Sterling while Odegaard was unable to influence play and found himself substituted when Arsenal were chasing the game.

Arteta is perhaps still working out how to maximise his options and it was noticeable that Kai Havertz was not only overlooked from the start but also left on the bench for all but the final 12 minutes with Emile Smith Rowe preferred in midfield as Arteta sought a response.

These are teething problems which will be masked by the second-half fight back. ""I really liked going into the dressing room [at full-time] and it's really quiet, after drawing 2-2 with Chelsea and coming back from 2-0 down, because I know that they wanted more,"" Arteta said.

For Pochettino, he extended a promising unbeaten run but the statement victory to signal they are on the right track has to wait. After Brentford next weekend and Blackburn in the Carabao Cup, Chelsea face Tottenham, City, Newcastle, Brighton and Manchester United. The good news for Chelsea is they won't have to wait long for another crack."
